I got a letter in XXXX from my prior lender, XXXX XXXX stating this was to occur and the next payment to be made would go to Roundpoint. XXXX XXXX 's letter provided the Roundpoint contact but no other info. XX/XX/XXXX, when I typically pay bills, I called Roundpoint and they said they did not have the transfer completed and could not provide me with any information so that I could pay the mortgage on time. They said I would receive a letter from Roundpoint when they were ready to receive payments. They reassured me that there was a 60 day grace period to allow all the customers to receive the necessary information to pay their mortgage. I never received a letter. I got a call about XX/XX/XXXX and the lady was quite rude, she said there is a grace period but the payment would still be listed as late, even though I couldn't have paid it without the loan number. As I tried to explain and ask for proper documentation she continually interrupting me. I stated I was waiting for a letter from them that clearly documents that the loan was transferred, the loan number, the amount of the loan and the interest. The rude customer service rep kept suggesting I could solve all these problems myself, and could have already paid the mortgage. This loan is {$450000.00}, and this is serious money to me. I want a document that shows the loan is accurate. There can be mistakes and fraud and I don't want to be a victim of a scam. She never assured me that a paper letter would arrive that would provide this needed and required information. She said "" check your email junk folder.. I did and a letter providing some basic info but not complete info was there. just enough to pay them, but no statement of loan amount or interest. This reeks of fraud. I would like them investigated. The mortgage industry has a very bad reputation and this is another example of why.

27,2023-02-24 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Hello, my name is XXXX XXXX. So 12 months ago I was notified that my bank failed to pay my homeowners insurance company XXXX XXXX insurance and that my policy had been cancelled I then had to get a hold of XXXX XXXX get a new policy for {$1200.00} which was {$500.00} more per year than my old Policy and frankly at the time I accepted that as a mistake by the bank & accepted it as an accident although very unfair. Fast forward 11 months later to XX/XX/2023 and I called my homeowners after water damage to my home to make a claim however my homeowners insurance company XXXX XXXX informed me that I had not had homeowners insurance in 11 months to which I replied that is impossible, the bank made me submit verification of the new policy 11 months ago so how is that possible? They say the bank sent the money too late. Yet no 1 informed me at all? How come my mortgage statements show that the money was paid to XXXX XXXX? & no one from 5/3 mentioned anything to me & i had spoken with them several times this past year about other issues. However it seems 5/3 is trained to never admit their faults. So naturally no one could explain to me where my {$1200.00} went from 11 months ago or why I have not had a policy for 11 ) months I was distraught last year when I didn't have it for three days because of 5/3 but i fixed their mistake as fast as humanly possible, but at this point its no longer a mistake, it's clearly negligence. They only deflect blame when the fault is clearly theirs. Now after more than two weeks, no 1 is assisting me, or calling me back, but no 1 is telling me where my money is or where it went when this escrow account is their obligation, infact I just got a notice stating that on XX/XX/XXXX my mortgage payment is going up from {$890.00} up to {$1000.00} a month due to my taxes and insurance going up they said however upon several calls and conflicting answers I finally got the truth from 5th third bank that they failed to pay my property taxes last year ( although this clearly differs from escrow statements they have sent me saying they paid insurance & taxes on specific dates! ) so now 2 payment must be made and that's why my payment went up so they can not say that they aren't at fault here after XXXX failed payments in less than 14 months. & when property taxes arent paid it increases what is owed. Will they pay that? The 5/3rd representatives ive spoken with havent offered anything financially to remedy this, or any help resolving it. XXXX seems has provided documentation that shows 5/3rd did not do their job. This is all a result of 5/3 failing to pay repeatedly, Which when you consider that they originally failed to pay 12 months ago costing me {$500.00} more a year, then failed to pay on time for new {$1200.00} policy, they failed to pay ontime, they failed to pay my property tax & im sure there are fees associated with paying it a year late, And on top of all of that, all I know is that I have atleast 10s of thousands in damage maybe more & no one is interested in fixing the home Where my five children reside, even though 5/3 has been proven time & again that they are negligently operating my escrow account & they are not taking responsibility for their actions or lack of actions even after I have called dozens of times & reasonably pointed out the issues & negative effects their negligence has had on my home, my family, My life & our future. 
I am the sole provider here And I work Monday through Friday XXXX XXXX  to XXXX XXXX  I've made all my payments I've done everything I was supposed to do & ive called 5/3rd dozens of times but I'm still left with no answers about my {$1200.00} or my damages all while forced to pay a higher mortgage payment that we can not afford & all due to this companies repeated mistakes. I have called & called looking for answers from attorneys & others but i am yet to find anything relevent.

45,2021-09-26 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Our mortgage history : We filed for Bankruptcy ( BK ) to save our home from Foreclosure XXXX as advised by XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( trustee and investor of IndyMac Bank now XXXX XXXX XXXX ) filed Relief from Stay. The BK Judge noted that our loan has a defective note for the fact that the loan was only under my husband 's name and only his signatures were on the loan docs. The property was our primary residence and was recorded under our names as husband and wife, joint tenancy ( we were married XXXX ). Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC ( who is the servicing company of IndyMac Bank/XXXX XXXX XXXX ) just sent us a notice dated XX/XX/XXXX saying they will foreclose our property in 30 days. We tried to apply for loan modification which they offered us, before we filed for BK but we were denied after they required us to send a money order of the new monthly payment {$1600.00} with our loan modification application ( we have copies of their offer and the payment we sent ). Our payment went up to {$3200.00}. We can't afford that kind of monthly payment. At that time, we were both still working. My husband is retired now ( he's XXXX yrs. old ) and I stopped working XXXX XXXX. I was on XXXX from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. I have 5 XXXX XXXX, have other medical problems We were denied of the loan modification. They gave us false Hope! We have to admit, we were ignorant and naive about the rules/laws or clueless and unsuspecting of any violation committed due to our lack of understanding ( XXXX is not our first language ) .I remember, the loan papers were just brought by a notary person to our residence. Since she was not a loan officer, there was no explanation about the loan or documents. She just verified the identification and took the signatures needed from my husband. I just learned that this is considered as a predatory loan besides the homestead code violation. It is my understanding that imposing unfair and abusive loan terms on borrowers, often through aggressive sales tactics, taking advantage of a borrower 's lack of understanding of complicated transactions is an outright deception. 

Another legal argument of our BK lawyer with the bank lawyer to oppose the Motion for Relief from Stay was : A community estate and a joint tenancy between a spouses can not exist at the same time in the same property. The reasoning was that the unity of interest was lacking between husband and wife, because at that time ( XXXX ) only husband and wife had exclusive equal rights of management and control. In a join tenancy, the right of survivorship precludes the community property ( California Probate Code XXXX ) Where a true joint tenancy between husband and wife exists the interest of each precludes the community should be their separate property Post marital creditors of one spouse share of a true joint tenancy ( California Family XXXX ) Regardless of the state of the title property must be either one or the other. It can not be both.When spouses take title of a joint tenancy, each spouse holds his or her own interest as separate property under California law if the community property presumption is overcome ( XXXX. 

The BK Judge even said, that the mortgage loan is defective ( I have a certified copy of the hearing transcrpt if needed ). 

This is only partial of the our situation/experience with IndyMac/XXXX XXXX XXXX . Ocwen is the Servicer but XXXX XXXX is the trustee who filed a Judicial Foreclose against my husband on XXXX. 

In this lawsuit XXXX ( see attached copy of their case where they admitted that the Deed of Trust was mistakenly not recorded. Also they stated that they were unable to locate and obtain an assignment transferring interest as encumbered by the Deed of Trust. Thefore a break in the chain of assignments has occurred. They admitted that the Deed of Trust was Mistakenly not recorded. Also they stated that they were unable to locate and obtain an assignment transferring interest as encumbered by the Deed of Trust directly to XXXX ( the bank ) therefore has a break in the chain of assignments has occurred and the bank must request a Judicial determination of the Court to foreclose our property, XXXX XXXX ( the original loan holder ) has ceased operations & no longer in business. As a defunct ntity with no employees, there is no one remaining capable of executing an assignment. 
The bank is informed and believes and alleged that as a result of an unrecorded and missing assignment, a break in the recorded chain of assignment exist The bank and the foreclosure trustee may not be able to conduct a non-judicial foreclosure sale and the bank must request a Judicial determination of the Court to foreclose this subject property, Loan Experts ( the original loan holder ) has ceased operations and no longer in business. As a defunct they admitted that the Deed of Trust to the Plaintiff was Mistakenly not recorded. Also they stated that they were unable to locate and obtain an assignment transferring interest as encumbered by the Deed of Trust directly to Plaintiff ( XXXX ), therefore a break in the chain of assignments has occurred and Plaintiff must request a Judicial determination of the Court to foreclose this subject property, Loan Experts ( the original loan holder ) has ceased operations and no longer in business. As a defunct entity with no employees, there is no one remaining capable of executing an executing an assignment. XXXX is informed and believes and alleged that as result of the unrecorded and missing assignment, a break in the recorded chain of assignment exists. The bank and the foreclosure trustee may not be able to conduct a non-judicial foreclosure. 

This case was withdrawn by XXXX XXXX but on XX/XX/XXXX, they did a Non Judicial Foreclosure on our property. We are still occupying the property because we have nowhere to go but we fear and very scared that we might be forced to leave anytime.We might get evicted anytime specially if the eviction hold ends this end of XXXX ( if not extended ). We are seniors and with housing crisis in the bay srea, we might end up in the streets. 

We are not trying to get this property for free but if they can give us a loan modification with the low interest with the {$500000.00} bad loan they gave us before, maybe we can still save the property. My son is willing to help us pay some monthly mortgage payment. We are on fixed income ( SS pension ). Maybe we can sell the property and they can just get the 1/2 interest value of my husband since the loan was under his name only ( I dont have any signature on the mortgage loan ). I assumed, they can not legally transfer the Deed of the property since they dont have unrecorded and missing /void assignments ( as they admitted ) plus I have my name in the original Deed of Trust.They violated my rights as a spouse who have 1/2 interest in the property ( as a joint tenancy ). 
We filed for Wrongful Foreclosure ( after the Non-Judicial Foreclosure on XXXX XXXX ) but it did never went to Trial. It was Demurred because they alleged that I signed a waiver or assigned the property to my husband married man, as sole and separate property. I denied this allegation. Who in a right mind will sign something like this? They have high caliver lawyers while we can only afford to maintain a lawyer but just a pro bono services ( we pay only what they do to us ). Our case was mishandled. 

If they want, we can sell the property but only the 1/2 value can go to them. The 1/2 value goes to the spouse since this is a joint tenancy. 

Whatever remedy you think is fair and right, please help us negotiate with the bank. They have a history of unfair practices and mortgage fraud ( I have articles that proves the allegations ) See attachments ) Can I fax or send the attachment separately via email? I have pages of documents to send. Can u give me your email please? I am not good in sending attachment. Sorry Thanks so much.

I have been paying the mortgage, keeping up the property and had been trying to decide whether or not to move back in at the time. ( no payments were over 30 days past due ) Upon arrival I noticed a Large party barge in my drive way, obstructing me from even getting near the home. once I did get up to the house, I immediately noticed that my front door was completely wide open to the outside. 
There was a lockbox attached to a new doorknob and both were locked however the door lock had not been engaged and although the mechanism was locked the door was open. 
Upon entering I saw that my original hardwood floors had obviously been affected as they had gaps, were filthy and did not look as they did the last time I had been in the house. 
When I had last been in the home, I had a cleaning CREW go from top to bottom to ready the home for rental and then I personally closed and locked the house. 
What I saw before me was terrible. All of the kitchen cabinets stood open and looked askew / wobbly and covered in dust residue. 
The same for the wood blinds in the front living room where the door was open. everything was now covered in mold. 
Additionally the BACK door was open AS WELL and the carpet was moldy and covered in leaves, spider webs, insects. 
The entire front part of my home is top to bottom covered in filth residue and insect matter. There is obvious weather and water damage.

I was met with an answering services and the run around with no one being able to explain why my home had been broken into. 
I did report the issue the day I discovered it both to you and to Penny Mac. 
Next I was told that I had to get independent contractors to the home to bid on the repairs. 
This also is no easy task as I have to WORK ALL DAY. But I did manage to get this done. I asked several times for your company to send their own people over to bid it but was met with many excuses. 

It amazes me that you and I have the name of your employee who signed in and we both know that had it not been for XXXX no damage would have occurred to my home. 
Not only are BOTH door frames damaged with the exact same sort of damage but also this person was so reckless and careless that he did not take the time needed to ensure that my HOUSE was locked and the probable first wind that came blew both doors open!

72,2021-01-26 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"XXXX XXXX ( Mortgagee ), being duly sworn hereby deposes and says : I am a mortgagee and owner for the property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX MD XXXX, ( Property ). 
I considered multiple mortgage lenders for the purchase of the Property. 
In late XXXX, I connected with XXXX XXXX, a Chase Mortgage lending advisor, about working with Chase to secure a mortgage for the Property. On XX/XX/XXXX, I agreed to move forward with Chase as the mortgage lender. 
Upon learning that I had received an offer from XXXX, XXXX XXXX offered to match that rate of 2.625 % with 0 points as well as offer an additional 1/8 percent rate discount via relationship pricing. I clearly communicated the need to complete the closing by XX/XX/XXXX, to which XXXX gave us her assurances that this would not be a problem based on the Chase Closing Guarantee. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX uploaded the first loan estimate package as agreed. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, my review of loan estimate package revealed multiple errors, including additional points being erroneously noted, no mention of relationship pricing, a higher than agreed to mortgage rate, and a error in the town of the Propertys address. Much of this remained uncorrected for some time despite multiple emails that alerted XXXX to these errors. XXXX assured me that she would fix these errors when the agreement went into underwriting. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX congratulated us that we had secured financing. Thereafter, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Chase Loan Processor, alerted us to missing information including the sales contract- information that we had clearly provided to XXXX previously by our attorney and Real Estate Agent. Despite this, I resubmitted and provided this information directly to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. With XX/XX/XXXX approaching, and concerns about XXXX errors and unresponsiveness, and valid worries about Chases ability to adhere to the terms of the mortgage and agreed upon deadlines, on XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX, a Lending Manager at Chase at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY. At this point, the closing date was set for XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX and XXXX assured us we would close on time. On XX/XX/XXXX, we heard from XXXX that XXXX was working to clear the loan as soon as possible. On XX/XX/XXXX, just one day before the agreed upon closing date, XXXX informed me that the closing may have to take place on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX came and went, and Chase failed to clear the loan. Despite XXXX informing me that he would extend the rate lock, the closing did not take place on the agreed upon date and he communicated that the closingwould take place by XXXX, XXXX or at latest, XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed XXXX XXXX, Executive Director at Chase to inform him of the process. While XXXX did not respond right away, XXXX XXXX assured us we would close on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I still had not received all the documents from Chase, and Lending Manager XXXX XXXX had apparently left the office for vacation. I was able to discuss with XXXX XXXX and we were eventually able to close on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 
Moving the closing date led the sellers to charge rent for the inconvenience of the delay and their detrimental reliance which put their contingent purchase of another home at risk. We supplied a check to cover this additional and unexpected cost due to Chases inability to close on the agreed upon closing date, despite the Chase Closing Guarantee. 
We were abundantly clear that before ultimately choosing Chase as a mortgage lender, that the closing needed to take place by XX/XX/XXXX. I detrimentally relied on the representations of Chase, its Chase Closing Guarantee, to close by XX/XX/XXXX. I moved large sums of money over to Chase in order to obtain relationship pricing. I incurred fees and missed work due to the unexpected, delayed closing. We relied on Chase standing by their guarantee. 
Lastly, I have reached out 5 times as early as XX/XX/XXXX and as late as XX/XX/XXXX regarding the Chase Closing Guarantee, and the responses have been that is handled by another department. Well let you know. No one has contacted us or let us know and it has been 3 weeks our delayed closing date. 
Our Attorney, XXXX XXXX, from XXXX XXXX XXXX attests to the lack of cooperation and the difficulty that Chase Bank exhibited during the transaction. He witnessed XXXX XXXX unresponsiveness and XXXX XXXX commitment to the adjusted closing date of Monday, XXXX XXXX despite XXXX XXXX promptly taking vacation the week of XX/XX/XXXX. This is concerning as XXXX has stated in an email that he was involved with the loan leading up to the closing and after making the commitment, he goes on vacation without informing the other parties that his involvement was complete.",None,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,MD,216XX,None,1,Web,2021-01-26 00:00:00.000000,Closed with explanation,1,1,4094618,-2.6362653

I requested a copy of the conversations that were recorded by Wells Fargo relative to my Complaint XXXX. The conversations recorded only had to do with my information and no proprietary information was shared. 
I requested the write-off ( satisfaction of my mortgage ) because of the constant delays in making a decision on the loan modification by the lender and lenders counsel ( s ) AND failure of lender and lenders counsel to notify me via my attorney of my approval of a XXXX  loan . 
When the final loan modification paperwork was provided, my mortgage was increased to {$140000.00} ( from {$100000.00} ) and the loan was increased from XXXX  years to XXXX years. 

In replying to this Complaint No. XXXX, Wells Fargo asked for XXXX ( XXXX ) consecutive extensions. With their final extension, Wells Fargo advised they would be unable to write-off the mortgage or reduce the amount of the mortgage because they SOLD my mortgage.

Approximately {$4000.00} of that approximately {$14000.00} was for predicted end of XXXX tax and insurance coverage however the other approximately {$10000.00} was said to be to cover money XXXX  paid forward during my forbearance. Being that they applied the full payment amount which includes escrow for each month I was in forbearance this money was already paid back in said payments. So they double charged me.

We sent an email on XX/XX/XXXX requesting an update and never heard from XXXX nor XXXX ever since.

114,2019-08-16 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Sirs My property at XXXX XXXX XXXX has had several water issues over the past 18 months leading to two prior insurance claims and a current claim. The source of the problem has now been identified it is a backup sewer line that had the previous plumbers put a camera through the sewer line they would have seen that the sewer line was damaged. 

The Loss My house is currently rented. On XX/XX/XXXX, the tenants used the powder room and the water overflowed emitting sewer water all over the wooden floors. They immediately called a plumber it was XXXX in the morning and the plumber put a camera through the line, cleaned up the sewer and discovered the sewer line was broken. 
The sewer water damage is extensive, causing damage on the main level and seeping through to the basement, where the celling collapsed and the sewer water went into the carpet in the basement. 
I was notified on XX/XX/XXXX and called the insurance company XXXX XXXX. They were closed for the holidays. XXXX came out to dry out the house and basement. There is still an outstanding bill for the XXXX remediation. 

The Insurance Coverage XXXX XXXX maximum payment for Back up Sewer loss is {$10000.00} ( see attached ) The adjuster came and estimated the work to repair the inside of the house the wooden floors, powder room, basement wall, replace the sewer line, replace basement carpet etc., is {$14000.00}. Hardly enough but because of the maximum back up sewer clause I did not see the point in asking for a re-estimate. Estimates to replace the sewer line ran from {$6500.00} - {$11000.00}. 

Work completed to date. 
This is a major loss involving water. 

1. Sewer Line i. I had to replace the line, to prevent any further damage. 
ii. There is nothing to inspect. The work is done under ground. XXXX inspected the line once the work was completed and validated it was up to code. You can check with them for validation providing them with the address. 
2. Humidifier i. I had to put humidifiers in the basement to prevent mold build up. There is mold growing on the wall and underneath the carpet. 
ii. XXXX provided this work I have not paid them yet. 

Chase Insurance Policy Chase needs to inspect the work in accordance with the Adjusters report. That is the standard process. However, it will not work in this instance because the loss exceeds the maximum coverage. The back up sewer coverage maximum is {$10000.00}. That has already been expended : the line needed to be replaced immediately, the house needed to be dried out with dehumidifiers. The landscaping. 

The powder room and wooden floors will have to be done later and can be inspected but I will have to fund this later. Yet these can be inspected, but will not be done. Again, the monies have been used to fix the sewer line that runs underneath the ground so unless we pull up the ground there is nothing to inspect. Yet I am told you need to inspect to release the funds. I have spent my own money and need the rest to fix the growing mold in the basement. 

I truly understand that you have to validate work, but there needs to be another process for loss that occurs as a result of a backup sewer. THERE IS NOTHING TO INSPECT. A better validation is to call the utility company. XXXX will validate that they certified the work. 

Outstanding Work Time is of the Essence The loss occurred 6 weeks ago. Water is in the house. The house still has a sewer smell. Mold is growing every single day in the basement. I have a contractor who is on standby to work on the mold remediation in the basement. He has to remove the dry wall, carpet etc., I need to pay him to get started this week. Hes quote for the basement is in excess of {$9000.00}. The wooden floors and powder room is another {$6000.00}. Clearly the insurance check will not cover the work to be completed. 

The ask Every day we are waiting to release funds is exacerbating the mold issue. I have already paid out close to {$9000.00} and would like it released to me this week so I can try and stop the bleeding the mold in the basement continues to grow every day during the damp, hot summer months. 
I understand there is a process for Chase Insurance Claims. I have been to Chase branch every day for the past 10 days and no one at the branch understood how to process the check. I am simply asking to be refunded for the monies spent to date so that I can pay another contractor to begin on the basement to stop further damage to the basement. 

Waiting on an inspector to come and check the work completed to date is futile. The work completed is underground the water pipe. A better validation for Chase is for you to contact XXXX who inspected the pipe before the concrete was replaced. 

I am happy to have the inspector can come out to check on the basement once it is completed. But the work to be completed needs funds and I have expended all my funds on the pipe replacement. 

Please advise what we need to do for Chase to refund me for monies spent to date so that I/We can protect the property from further damage.",None,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,MD,20721,None,1,Web,2019-08-16 00:00:00.000000,Closed with explanation,1,1,3343030,-2.0358458
122,2021-01-18 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"We refinanced in XX/XX/XXXX, our loan was then sold to BSI Financial Services in XXXX and first paymet was due XX/XX/XXXX. 

At the end of XXXX we received a mortgage statement from BSI and went to the website listed myloanweb.com/BSI. We created an account so that we could pay our mortgage. 

First problem ( I have pictures of this as well ) when we login to the main page we have a popup that says we've partnered with XXXX XXXX to get you insurance ( home owners which we couldn't have refinanced without proving that we have homeowners insurance ). This popup blocked our loan #, due date as well as how much we needed to pay. There was no 'x ' button and no way to get off the screen. After calling I was told to click anywhere along the edge and it would disapppear but every time I navigate back to the home screen ( not even just every time I login ) the popup is there again. No ability to turn it off ( as of XX/XX/XXXX I can now turn it off for up to 90 days so that is better but still really annoying ). I do not expect to have telemarketing material shoved at me when I go to pay my mortgage. Previously our mortgage has been with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and if they ever asked a question such as would you like quotes on refinancing it was as you logged in and then you didn't see it again and never showed up blocking any information - clear to click on yes or no. 

Second problem - when I go to pay my mortgage online, I am asked for bank information ( totally normal ) but unlike every other institution I have worked with ( utility companies included ) I have no means to link my bank account to my mortgage and instead every single month ( for the next 15 yrs if I am stuck with them ) I have to put in Bank name, bank city, bank state, borrower type, bank acct type, routing number, acct number. First month they even claimed I was not a borrower but I got that resolved. I don't know a lot of those numbers ( namely the routing number which is not so easy to always find ) and usually I just add it in once, verify small deposits or however they link the accounts and then choose that account to pay from going forward. Now I can't do that unless I want them to do automatic payments which I do not want in any way. I pay on different days each month ( around the same time ) but I may have to move money from a business account to a personal account to pay the personal bills and therefore don't want a large sum being deducted automatically ( plus many months I pay extra ). I tried to pay via ACH through our personal checking account and BSI is not listed so would take at least a week for a physical check to reach them. BSI said they don't accept ACH payments so only reasonable way to pay is via myloanweb.com/BSI. 

Third problem - every other loan/account XXXX have/had, it is clearly stated the due date as well as the 'grace period '. For BSI it never says you have until XXXX day of the month or XXXX to pay, as soon as you login it says you are delinquent if you login on the second. Our mortgage broker explained that under federal law, we have until the XXXX to pay our mortgage before its considered late, before we can get late fees or that it would be reported to the credit bureaus. In fact on the paper bills it says no late fee will be charged if payment is received after the XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I went to pay my bills ( well most of my bills I paid the previous day but since I had to look up a lot of info for BSI I had to wait till I had more than a minute or two ) and went to one time payment - online payment and noticed that there was listed a {$7.00} processing fee added to my payment. When I called, I was told that is because it was after the XXXX and they add that fee and they can't remove it. Well that is not acceptable, they have no right to add to my mortgage and nothing was ever stated telling us this. After speaking with a supervisor, he agreed to waive any late fees and promised that we would not get reported to the credit bureau and gave us the information so that we could have a check sent to them from our bank but this is not a viable long term solution ( truthfully had hoped to pay mortgage down by an extra {$1000.00} but I'm not giving them anything extra ) I have images of every issues with personal details blacked out that I have described above. The answer every time I call BSI is to setup auto payment. 

We have a standard 15 year fixed rate mortgage. We have owned our home for over 15 years and during that time we have never been late on a payment or not paid in full. We have good credit scores and have had no problem getting a mortgage or refinancing. I pay all my bills online within the first 8 days of every month ( utilties, mortgage, credit card, phone/internet etc. ) and have had no problem using 1 time payments for each of these ( all clearly state when and how much of a late fee will be assessed or if you pay via credit card you will incur x % or $ x amount.",None,"BSI Financial Holdings, Inc.",NJ,07052,None,1,Web,2021-01-18 00:00:00.000000,Closed with explanation,1,1,4075525,-2.0172763

Not both. We owned it outright and its value is approx XXXX. I had recently been diagnosed with XXXX and was about to start XXXX. We needed the extra money to pay Bill 's we were behind on and get a new vehicle. We let them know I wasnt working and was fighting social security. We still are. We wanted XXXX and was approved and told to come back the next day to sign papers. We asked for a XXXX dollar advance and was told we could pick the check up in two days. When we came back mrs. XXXX told us that an old loan of mine was never paid off even though my check was garnished. My former employer only paid half of it and they claimed to now i was responsible for the rest even tho j paid it in full to her. They said they would have to finance what I owed into the loan and would have to sue her. They said they would get me the paperwork as to what I owed and what was being financed and also how much interest it would accumalate over the term so I would know the amount to survive for. Never got it. I've asked several times. This changed the rate on the loan, the payments, and the length. It went from a four year loan to six and the apr changed to 31percent. At  the end of the term we will be paying back XXXX. At no point in time were we ever told that the advance we got was another loan that was opened on XX/XX/XXXX and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. They charged us XXXX to finance it into our loan and then financed XXXX on top of the XXXX we borrowed and the XXXX I owed from the old loan. 
When I started XXXX, it was detrimental to my health and our finances. I was in and out of the hospital in XXXX for three months. I emailed and called liberty and asked for help. They never responded. I was well enough at one point to go down there and ask about getting some help or for a pass on a payment to help us while we were going thru the financial hardship. XXXX, the manager couldnt explain to me the reasons why the numbers didnt match on the loan regarding the cash in hand and the two loans that we didnt know about. The numbers on the loam.theybsaid in owed didnt match the paperwork they had sent me a year prior compared to what they financed on the loan. The payoffs were different. The amount t owed was less on my old.letter. He couldnt give me any paperwork and said I had to wait for XXXX. I got sick again and they did not offer any help towards the situation. They never had us sign two loans. They didnt even research the title but they charged us XXXX for it. I did the title search. We never had an appraisal. It was the owner, XXXX and XXXX who came. We didnt realize the land had been put into the loan until we faced foreclosure for the first time. This is the third time and the numbers still dont match. Our credit report isn't correct on what we have paid and it hasn't been a year yet. We owe XXXX on monday or our house and land gets sold. We paid XXXX three months ago when they tried to foreclose.

I am attaching copies of my bank statements that show each payment was auto withdrawn from my account, as well as the letter I received from Movement stating I was in default. 
I immediately called Movements phone number as provided on the default letter to find out why I received this letter and was told this is some type of servicing issue on their end and that both my XXXX and XXXX payments were received but put into a suspense account held by Movement because they took out the incorrect payment amount in XXXX.
