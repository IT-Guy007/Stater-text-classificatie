27,2023-02-24 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Hello, my name is XXXX XXXX. So 12 months ago I was notified that my bank failed to pay my homeowners insurance company XXXX XXXX insurance and that my policy had been cancelled I then had to get a hold of XXXX XXXX get a new policy for {$1200.00} which was {$500.00} more per year than my old Policy and frankly at the time I accepted that as a mistake by the bank & accepted it as an accident although very unfair. Fast forward 11 months later to XX/XX/2023 and I called my homeowners after water damage to my home to make a claim however my homeowners insurance company XXXX XXXX informed me that I had not had homeowners insurance in 11 months to which I replied that is impossible, the bank made me submit verification of the new policy 11 months ago so how is that possible? They say the bank sent the money too late. Yet no 1 informed me at all? How come my mortgage statements show that the money was paid to XXXX XXXX? & no one from 5/3 mentioned anything to me & i had spoken with them several times this past year about other issues. However it seems 5/3 is trained to never admit their faults. So naturally no one could explain to me where my {$1200.00} went from 11 months ago or why I have not had a policy for 11 ) months I was distraught last year when I didn't have it for three days because of 5/3 but i fixed their mistake as fast as humanly possible, but at this point its no longer a mistake, it's clearly negligence. They only deflect blame when the fault is clearly theirs. Now after more than two weeks, no 1 is assisting me, or calling me back, but no 1 is telling me where my money is or where it went when this escrow account is their obligation, infact I just got a notice stating that on XX/XX/XXXX my mortgage payment is going up from {$890.00} up to {$1000.00} a month due to my taxes and insurance going up they said however upon several calls and conflicting answers I finally got the truth from 5th third bank that they failed to pay my property taxes last year ( although this clearly differs from escrow statements they have sent me saying they paid insurance & taxes on specific dates! ) so now 2 payment must be made and that's why my payment went up so they can not say that they aren't at fault here after XXXX failed payments in less than 14 months. & when property taxes arent paid it increases what is owed. Will they pay that? The 5/3rd representatives ive spoken with havent offered anything financially to remedy this, or any help resolving it. XXXX seems has provided documentation that shows 5/3rd did not do their job. This is all a result of 5/3 failing to pay repeatedly, Which when you consider that they originally failed to pay 12 months ago costing me {$500.00} more a year, then failed to pay on time for new {$1200.00} policy, they failed to pay ontime, they failed to pay my property tax & im sure there are fees associated with paying it a year late, And on top of all of that, all I know is that I have atleast 10s of thousands in damage maybe more & no one is interested in fixing the home Where my five children reside, even though 5/3 has been proven time & again that they are negligently operating my escrow account & they are not taking responsibility for their actions or lack of actions even after I have called dozens of times & reasonably pointed out the issues & negative effects their negligence has had on my home, my family, My life & our future. 
I am the sole provider here And I work Monday through Friday XXXX XXXX  to XXXX XXXX  I've made all my payments I've done everything I was supposed to do & ive called 5/3rd dozens of times but I'm still left with no answers about my {$1200.00} or my damages all while forced to pay a higher mortgage payment that we can not afford & all due to this companies repeated mistakes. I have called & called looking for answers from attorneys & others but i am yet to find anything relevent.

45,2021-09-26 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Our mortgage history : We filed for Bankruptcy ( BK ) to save our home from Foreclosure XXXX as advised by XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( trustee and investor of IndyMac Bank now XXXX XXXX XXXX ) filed Relief from Stay. The BK Judge noted that our loan has a defective note for the fact that the loan was only under my husband 's name and only his signatures were on the loan docs. The property was our primary residence and was recorded under our names as husband and wife, joint tenancy ( we were married XXXX ). Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC ( who is the servicing company of IndyMac Bank/XXXX XXXX XXXX ) just sent us a notice dated XX/XX/XXXX saying they will foreclose our property in 30 days. We tried to apply for loan modification which they offered us, before we filed for BK but we were denied after they required us to send a money order of the new monthly payment {$1600.00} with our loan modification application ( we have copies of their offer and the payment we sent ). Our payment went up to {$3200.00}. We can't afford that kind of monthly payment. At that time, we were both still working. My husband is retired now ( he's XXXX yrs. old ) and I stopped working XXXX XXXX. I was on XXXX from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. I have 5 XXXX XXXX, have other medical problems We were denied of the loan modification. They gave us false Hope! We have to admit, we were ignorant and naive about the rules/laws or clueless and unsuspecting of any violation committed due to our lack of understanding ( XXXX is not our first language ) .I remember, the loan papers were just brought by a notary person to our residence. Since she was not a loan officer, there was no explanation about the loan or documents. She just verified the identification and took the signatures needed from my husband. I just learned that this is considered as a predatory loan besides the homestead code violation. It is my understanding that imposing unfair and abusive loan terms on borrowers, often through aggressive sales tactics, taking advantage of a borrower 's lack of understanding of complicated transactions is an outright deception. 

Another legal argument of our BK lawyer with the bank lawyer to oppose the Motion for Relief from Stay was : A community estate and a joint tenancy between a spouses can not exist at the same time in the same property. The reasoning was that the unity of interest was lacking between husband and wife, because at that time ( XXXX ) only husband and wife had exclusive equal rights of management and control. In a join tenancy, the right of survivorship precludes the community property ( California Probate Code XXXX ) Where a true joint tenancy between husband and wife exists the interest of each precludes the community should be their separate property Post marital creditors of one spouse share of a true joint tenancy ( California Family XXXX ) Regardless of the state of the title property must be either one or the other. It can not be both.When spouses take title of a joint tenancy, each spouse holds his or her own interest as separate property under California law if the community property presumption is overcome ( XXXX. 

The BK Judge even said, that the mortgage loan is defective ( I have a certified copy of the hearing transcrpt if needed ). 

This is only partial of the our situation/experience with IndyMac/XXXX XXXX XXXX . Ocwen is the Servicer but XXXX XXXX is the trustee who filed a Judicial Foreclose against my husband on XXXX. 

In this lawsuit XXXX ( see attached copy of their case where they admitted that the Deed of Trust was mistakenly not recorded. Also they stated that they were unable to locate and obtain an assignment transferring interest as encumbered by the Deed of Trust. Thefore a break in the chain of assignments has occurred. They admitted that the Deed of Trust was Mistakenly not recorded. Also they stated that they were unable to locate and obtain an assignment transferring interest as encumbered by the Deed of Trust directly to XXXX ( the bank ) therefore has a break in the chain of assignments has occurred and the bank must request a Judicial determination of the Court to foreclose our property, XXXX XXXX ( the original loan holder ) has ceased operations & no longer in business. As a defunct ntity with no employees, there is no one remaining capable of executing an assignment. 
The bank is informed and believes and alleged that as a result of an unrecorded and missing assignment, a break in the recorded chain of assignment exist The bank and the foreclosure trustee may not be able to conduct a non-judicial foreclosure sale and the bank must request a Judicial determination of the Court to foreclose this subject property, Loan Experts ( the original loan holder ) has ceased operations and no longer in business. As a defunct they admitted that the Deed of Trust to the Plaintiff was Mistakenly not recorded. Also they stated that they were unable to locate and obtain an assignment transferring interest as encumbered by the Deed of Trust directly to Plaintiff ( XXXX ), therefore a break in the chain of assignments has occurred and Plaintiff must request a Judicial determination of the Court to foreclose this subject property, Loan Experts ( the original loan holder ) has ceased operations and no longer in business. As a defunct entity with no employees, there is no one remaining capable of executing an executing an assignment. XXXX is informed and believes and alleged that as result of the unrecorded and missing assignment, a break in the recorded chain of assignment exists. The bank and the foreclosure trustee may not be able to conduct a non-judicial foreclosure. 

This case was withdrawn by XXXX XXXX but on XX/XX/XXXX, they did a Non Judicial Foreclosure on our property. We are still occupying the property because we have nowhere to go but we fear and very scared that we might be forced to leave anytime.We might get evicted anytime specially if the eviction hold ends this end of XXXX ( if not extended ). We are seniors and with housing crisis in the bay srea, we might end up in the streets. 

We are not trying to get this property for free but if they can give us a loan modification with the low interest with the {$500000.00} bad loan they gave us before, maybe we can still save the property. My son is willing to help us pay some monthly mortgage payment. We are on fixed income ( SS pension ). Maybe we can sell the property and they can just get the 1/2 interest value of my husband since the loan was under his name only ( I dont have any signature on the mortgage loan ). I assumed, they can not legally transfer the Deed of the property since they dont have unrecorded and missing /void assignments ( as they admitted ) plus I have my name in the original Deed of Trust.They violated my rights as a spouse who have 1/2 interest in the property ( as a joint tenancy ). 
We filed for Wrongful Foreclosure ( after the Non-Judicial Foreclosure on XXXX XXXX ) but it did never went to Trial. It was Demurred because they alleged that I signed a waiver or assigned the property to my husband married man, as sole and separate property. I denied this allegation. Who in a right mind will sign something like this? They have high caliver lawyers while we can only afford to maintain a lawyer but just a pro bono services ( we pay only what they do to us ). Our case was mishandled. 

If they want, we can sell the property but only the 1/2 value can go to them. The 1/2 value goes to the spouse since this is a joint tenancy. 

Whatever remedy you think is fair and right, please help us negotiate with the bank. They have a history of unfair practices and mortgage fraud ( I have articles that proves the allegations ) See attachments ) Can I fax or send the attachment separately via email? I have pages of documents to send. Can u give me your email please? I am not good in sending attachment. Sorry Thanks so much.

I have been paying the mortgage, keeping up the property and had been trying to decide whether or not to move back in at the time.

There was a lockbox attached to a new doorknob and both were locked however the door lock had not been engaged and although the mechanism was locked the door was open.

I Do not know the exact date of the last day I went into the home prior to when XXXX  knocked my doors down, damaging both door frames irreparably and then left my house UNSECURED. 
It must have been XXXX of XXXX. 
How could this be that I have a vacant house and I am not just going over there every week to check on it? Well as I have mentioned to you I am a single mother. 
I have a full time job and am raising my 2 sons alone. My oldest son has XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX and much of my time is spent devoted to him. 
Never in my wildest imagination would I have dreamt that anyone could have legally done what your company did to me and not only get away with it but CHARGE ME FOR IT. 

The literal moment that I discovered this damage to my property at XXXX XXXX and subsequently found the XXXX XXXX  / PENNYMAC Mortgage sign in sheet on the countertop, I contacted both companies. 
I was met with an answering services and the run around with no one being able to explain why my home had been broken into. 
I did report the issue the day I discovered it both to you and to Penny Mac. 
Next I was told that I had to get independent contractors to the home to bid on the repairs. 
This also is no easy task as I have to WORK ALL DAY. But I did manage to get this done. I asked several times for your company to send their own people over to bid it but was met with many excuses. 

It amazes me that you and I have the name of your employee who signed in and we both know that had it not been for XXXX no damage would have occurred to my home. 
Not only are BOTH door frames damaged with the exact same sort of damage but also this person was so reckless and careless that he did not take the time needed to ensure that my HOUSE was locked and the probable first wind that came blew both doors open! 
Both Pennymac Mortgage and XXXX properties have decided that they will not repair the destruction to my property- the ONLY thing I own of any value. 
Additionally pennymac has applied thousands of dollars of my mortgage payments to XXXX  payments and deemed me "" late '' when in reality I was paying on time which has wrecked my credit.

I considered multiple mortgage lenders for the purchase of the Property. 
In late XXXX, I connected with XXXX XXXX, a Chase Mortgage lending advisor, about working with Chase to secure a mortgage for the Property. On XX/XX/XXXX, I agreed to move forward with Chase as the mortgage lender. 
Upon learning that I had received an offer from XXXX, XXXX XXXX offered to match that rate of 2.625 % with 0 points as well as offer an additional 1/8 percent rate discount via relationship pricing. I clearly communicated the need to complete the closing by XX/XX/XXXX, to which XXXX gave us her assurances that this would not be a problem based on the Chase Closing Guarantee. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX uploaded the first loan estimate package as agreed. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, my review of loan estimate package revealed multiple errors, including additional points being erroneously noted, no mention of relationship pricing, a higher than agreed to mortgage rate, and a error in the town of the Propertys address. Much of this remained uncorrected for some time despite multiple emails that alerted XXXX to these errors. XXXX assured me that she would fix these errors when the agreement went into underwriting. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX congratulated us that we had secured financing. Thereafter, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Chase Loan Processor, alerted us to missing information including the sales contract- information that we had clearly provided to XXXX previously by our attorney and Real Estate Agent. Despite this, I resubmitted and provided this information directly to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. With XX/XX/XXXX approaching, and concerns about XXXX errors and unresponsiveness, and valid worries about Chases ability to adhere to the terms of the mortgage and agreed upon deadlines, on XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX, a Lending Manager at Chase at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY. At this point, the closing date was set for XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX and XXXX assured us we would close on time. On XX/XX/XXXX, we heard from XXXX that XXXX was working to clear the loan as soon as possible. On XX/XX/XXXX, just one day before the agreed upon closing date, XXXX informed me that the closing may have to take place on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX came and went, and Chase failed to clear the loan. Despite XXXX informing me that he would extend the rate lock, the closing did not take place on the agreed upon date and he communicated that the closingwould take place by XXXX, XXXX or at latest, XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed XXXX XXXX, Executive Director at Chase to inform him of the process. While XXXX did not respond right away, XXXX XXXX assured us we would close on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I still had not received all the documents from Chase, and Lending Manager XXXX XXXX had apparently left the office for vacation. I was able to discuss with XXXX XXXX and we were eventually able to close on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 
Moving the closing date led the sellers to charge rent for the inconvenience of the delay and their detrimental reliance which put their contingent purchase of another home at risk. We supplied a check to cover this additional and unexpected cost due to Chases inability to close on the agreed upon closing date, despite the Chase Closing Guarantee. 
We were abundantly clear that before ultimately choosing Chase as a mortgage lender, that the closing needed to take place by XX/XX/XXXX. I detrimentally relied on the representations of Chase, its Chase Closing Guarantee, to close by XX/XX/XXXX. I moved large sums of money over to Chase in order to obtain relationship pricing. I incurred fees and missed work due to the unexpected, delayed closing. We relied on Chase standing by their guarantee. 
Lastly, I have reached out 5 times as early as XX/XX/XXXX and as late as XX/XX/XXXX regarding the Chase Closing Guarantee, and the responses have been that is handled by another department. Well let you know. No one has contacted us or let us know and it has been 3 weeks our delayed closing date. 
Our Attorney, XXXX XXXX, from XXXX XXXX XXXX attests to the lack of cooperation and the difficulty that Chase Bank exhibited during the transaction. He witnessed XXXX XXXX unresponsiveness and XXXX XXXX commitment to the adjusted closing date of Monday, XXXX XXXX despite XXXX XXXX promptly taking vacation the week of XX/XX/XXXX.

They applied the funds to every payment I missed which included principal interest and taxes and insurance. During forbearance XXXX obviously covered my insurance and property taxes for me and when all payments were made with the HAF funds any money they paid forward would have been repaid but they took a separate {$14000.00} solely for escrow as well. Approximately {$4000.00} of that approximately {$14000.00} was for predicted end of XXXX tax and insurance coverage however the other approximately {$10000.00} was said to be to cover money XXXX  paid forward during my forbearance. Being that they applied the full payment amount which includes escrow for each month I was in forbearance this money was already paid back in said payments. So they double charged me. Also per haf fund guidelines they were not allowed to charge late fees and they charged me numerous late fees in various amounts. All over in the documents and statements are numerous servicing fees at random amounts, one being for over {$4200.00}. Then after receiving haf funds, applying the payments in full and taking double on separate escrow costs as well they went and reported twelve late payments to the credit bureau.

Within half an hour after leaving a voicemail, XXXX XXXX, XXXX 's "" partner '' as she described herself contacted me back. I briefed her on my plans for purchasing a home and the need to do so by XXXX of XXXX at the latest. After providing personal information to XXXX about myself and my co-applicant ( which I introduced to XXXX and XXXX as my partner at the time ) she quickly requested to do a credit check to which she reported that my co-applicant needed to increase credit score. XXXX promised to send a copy of both our credit reports via email that same evening to which she did on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  and copied XXXX XXXX, with instructions on how to increase credit scores and how to provide proof of increases to Synovus Bank at her attention. XXXX also said she would provide an XXXX  worksheet with approximate pre-approval information/breakdowns since my co-applicant and I knew the home we were trying to purchase ; she never sent the worksheets. I requested the fax number to send proof documents on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX am via email and sent another follow-up email on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  since I did not receive a response from XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX. A couple of minutes after my follow-up email, XXXX responded via email on XX/XX/XXXX but did not provide the XXXX worksheets.

I also requested that XXXX and XXXX be transparent with us regarding our likelihood of being preapproved so that we could know exactly where we stand and what we need to do since we were on a time constraint with our current living situation. XXXX simply responded later that afternoon that my co-applicant 's scores are "" a little low '' and she will "" get with XXXX '' and they will provide an update. From the beginning to the end NO ONE ever explicitly expressed that we would not be approved. XXXX finally reached out via email at XXXX pm on XX/XX/XXXX claiming she "" lost her XXXX and XXXX, and needed to get it reinstalled '' and a bunch of other reasons as to why she was providing the XXXX FHA purchase estimate worksheet 6 days after she initially promised.

114,2019-08-16 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Sirs My property at XXXX XXXX XXXX has had several water issues over the past 18 months leading to two prior insurance claims and a current claim. The source of the problem has now been identified it is a backup sewer line that had the previous plumbers put a camera through the sewer line they would have seen that the sewer line was damaged. 

The Loss My house is currently rented. On XX/XX/XXXX, the tenants used the powder room and the water overflowed emitting sewer water all over the wooden floors. They immediately called a plumber it was XXXX in the morning and the plumber put a camera through the line, cleaned up the sewer and discovered the sewer line was broken. 
The sewer water damage is extensive, causing damage on the main level and seeping through to the basement, where the celling collapsed and the sewer water went into the carpet in the basement. 
I was notified on XX/XX/XXXX and called the insurance company XXXX XXXX. They were closed for the holidays. XXXX came out to dry out the house and basement. There is still an outstanding bill for the XXXX remediation. 

The Insurance Coverage XXXX XXXX maximum payment for Back up Sewer loss is {$10000.00} ( see attached ) The adjuster came and estimated the work to repair the inside of the house the wooden floors, powder room, basement wall, replace the sewer line, replace basement carpet etc., is {$14000.00}. Hardly enough but because of the maximum back up sewer clause I did not see the point in asking for a re-estimate. Estimates to replace the sewer line ran from {$6500.00} - {$11000.00}. 

Work completed to date. 
This is a major loss involving water. 

1. Sewer Line i. I had to replace the line, to prevent any further damage. 
ii. There is nothing to inspect. The work is done under ground. XXXX inspected the line once the work was completed and validated it was up to code. You can check with them for validation providing them with the address. 
2. Humidifier i. I had to put humidifiers in the basement to prevent mold build up. There is mold growing on the wall and underneath the carpet. 
ii. XXXX provided this work I have not paid them yet. 

Chase Insurance Policy Chase needs to inspect the work in accordance with the Adjusters report. That is the standard process. However, it will not work in this instance because the loss exceeds the maximum coverage. The back up sewer coverage maximum is {$10000.00}. That has already been expended : the line needed to be replaced immediately, the house needed to be dried out with dehumidifiers. The landscaping. 

The powder room and wooden floors will have to be done later and can be inspected but I will have to fund this later. Yet these can be inspected, but will not be done. Again, the monies have been used to fix the sewer line that runs underneath the ground so unless we pull up the ground there is nothing to inspect. Yet I am told you need to inspect to release the funds. I have spent my own money and need the rest to fix the growing mold in the basement. 

I truly understand that you have to validate work, but there needs to be another process for loss that occurs as a result of a backup sewer. THERE IS NOTHING TO INSPECT. A better validation is to call the utility company. XXXX will validate that they certified the work. 

Outstanding Work Time is of the Essence The loss occurred 6 weeks ago. Water is in the house. The house still has a sewer smell. Mold is growing every single day in the basement. I have a contractor who is on standby to work on the mold remediation in the basement. He has to remove the dry wall, carpet etc., I need to pay him to get started this week. Hes quote for the basement is in excess of {$9000.00}. The wooden floors and powder room is another {$6000.00}. Clearly the insurance check will not cover the work to be completed. 

The ask Every day we are waiting to release funds is exacerbating the mold issue. I have already paid out close to {$9000.00} and would like it released to me this week so I can try and stop the bleeding the mold in the basement continues to grow every day during the damp, hot summer months. 
I understand there is a process for Chase Insurance Claims. I have been to Chase branch every day for the past 10 days and no one at the branch understood how to process the check. I am simply asking to be refunded for the monies spent to date so that I can pay another contractor to begin on the basement to stop further damage to the basement. 

Waiting on an inspector to come and check the work completed to date is futile. The work completed is underground the water pipe. A better validation for Chase is for you to contact XXXX who inspected the pipe before the concrete was replaced. 

I am happy to have the inspector can come out to check on the basement once it is completed. But the work to be completed needs funds and I have expended all my funds on the pipe replacement. 

Please advise what we need to do for Chase to refund me for monies spent to date so that I/We can protect the property from further damage.",None,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,MD,20721,None,1,Web,2019-08-16 00:00:00.000000,Closed with explanation,1,1,3343030,"[-2.0358458, -2.2247915, -2.3361707, -2.1797712, -1.7463468, -1.28261, -1.9170113, -0.89063156, -1.911783, -0.7773932]"
122,2021-01-18 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"We refinanced in XX/XX/XXXX, our loan was then sold to BSI Financial Services in XXXX and first paymet was due XX/XX/XXXX. 

At the end of XXXX we received a mortgage statement from BSI and went to the website listed myloanweb.com/BSI. We created an account so that we could pay our mortgage. 

First problem ( I have pictures of this as well ) when we login to the main page we have a popup that says we've partnered with XXXX XXXX to get you insurance ( home owners which we couldn't have refinanced without proving that we have homeowners insurance ). This popup blocked our loan #, due date as well as how much we needed to pay. There was no 'x ' button and no way to get off the screen. After calling I was told to click anywhere along the edge and it would disapppear but every time I navigate back to the home screen ( not even just every time I login ) the popup is there again. No ability to turn it off ( as of XX/XX/XXXX I can now turn it off for up to 90 days so that is better but still really annoying ). I do not expect to have telemarketing material shoved at me when I go to pay my mortgage. Previously our mortgage has been with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and if they ever asked a question such as would you like quotes on refinancing it was as you logged in and then you didn't see it again and never showed up blocking any information - clear to click on yes or no. 

Second problem - when I go to pay my mortgage online, I am asked for bank information ( totally normal ) but unlike every other institution I have worked with ( utility companies included ) I have no means to link my bank account to my mortgage and instead every single month ( for the next 15 yrs if I am stuck with them ) I have to put in Bank name, bank city, bank state, borrower type, bank acct type, routing number, acct number. First month they even claimed I was not a borrower but I got that resolved. I don't know a lot of those numbers ( namely the routing number which is not so easy to always find ) and usually I just add it in once, verify small deposits or however they link the accounts and then choose that account to pay from going forward. Now I can't do that unless I want them to do automatic payments which I do not want in any way. I pay on different days each month ( around the same time ) but I may have to move money from a business account to a personal account to pay the personal bills and therefore don't want a large sum being deducted automatically ( plus many months I pay extra ). I tried to pay via ACH through our personal checking account and BSI is not listed so would take at least a week for a physical check to reach them. BSI said they don't accept ACH payments so only reasonable way to pay is via myloanweb.com/BSI. 

Third problem - every other loan/account XXXX have/had, it is clearly stated the due date as well as the 'grace period '. For BSI it never says you have until XXXX day of the month or XXXX to pay, as soon as you login it says you are delinquent if you login on the second. Our mortgage broker explained that under federal law, we have until the XXXX to pay our mortgage before its considered late, before we can get late fees or that it would be reported to the credit bureaus. In fact on the paper bills it says no late fee will be charged if payment is received after the XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I went to pay my bills ( well most of my bills I paid the previous day but since I had to look up a lot of info for BSI I had to wait till I had more than a minute or two ) and went to one time payment - online payment and noticed that there was listed a {$7.00} processing fee added to my payment. When I called, I was told that is because it was after the XXXX and they add that fee and they can't remove it. Well that is not acceptable, they have no right to add to my mortgage and nothing was ever stated telling us this. After speaking with a supervisor, he agreed to waive any late fees and promised that we would not get reported to the credit bureau and gave us the information so that we could have a check sent to them from our bank but this is not a viable long term solution ( truthfully had hoped to pay mortgage down by an extra {$1000.00} but I'm not giving them anything extra ) I have images of every issues with personal details blacked out that I have described above. The answer every time I call BSI is to setup auto payment. 

We have a standard 15 year fixed rate mortgage. We have owned our home for over 15 years and during that time we have never been late on a payment or not paid in full. We have good credit scores and have had no problem getting a mortgage or refinancing.

I called Movement on XX/XX/XXXX inquiring about the lesser payment amount and was told that was due to an overcollection of escrows at my closing which had adjusted my monthly future payment amounts down to {$1800.00}. 
A few days ago, I received an envelope in the mail with information stating that my loan was in default and that I had never made any payments which is clearly not true because Movement AUTO WITHDREW them from my bank account.

My loan was originated by XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX and subsequently sold to XXXX XXXX with the servicing rights to Shellpoint. The appraised value of my home at origination was {$130000.00}. The current unpaid principal balance of my loan is approximately {$97000.00} for a current loan-to-value ratio ( LTV ) of approximately 74 %. Please note, these numbers are my best guess because I cant locate my original appraisal my LTV could be lower if the appraised value at origination was higher. Also, my loan is a conventional 30-year loan, single family residence, my principal residence, and I have never been 30 days delinquent on my mortgage payment. As an individual who has worked for over 50 years, Im planning to XXXX  soon and need every dollar possible. In an effort to maximize my fixed income for XXXX  purposes, I requested PMI to be terminate by Shellpoint on XX/XX/XXXX through a call with customer service. I paid an additional {$4700.00} to principal XXXX to ensure I was below the LTV threshold only to be denied by Shellpoint. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Shellpoint sent me a denial letter for my request to terminate PMI. Shellpoint stated I have not meet XXXX XXXX requirements to lift PMI because my LTV was not 70 %. Shellpoint is violating the HPA by requiring I pay down my mortgage balance to 70 % of its original value again, this is a single-family home and my principal residence. 

HPA 4902 ( b ) states, ( b ) Automatic termination A requirement for private mortgage insurance in connection with a residential mortgage transaction shall terminate with respect to payments for that mortgage insurance made by the mortgagor -- ( 1 ) on the termination date if, on that date, the mortgagor is current on the payments required by the terms of the residential mortgage transaction ; or ( 2 ) if the mortgagor is not current on the termination date, on the first day of the first month beginning after the date that the mortgagor becomes current on the payments required by the terms of the residential mortgage transaction. 
4901 ( 18 ) states ( 18 ) Termination date means -- ( A ) with respect to a fixed rate mortgage, the date on which the principal balance of the mortgage, based solely on the initial amortization schedule for that mortgage, and irrespective of the outstanding balance for that mortgage on that date, is first scheduled to reach 78 percent of the original value of the property securing the loan. 

Not only did Shellpoint error and deny my request for PMI termination, they told me to remove it I needed to PAYOFF my loan, see attached denial letter. Based on the LTV, Shellpoint should have removed my PMI automatically, I should not have even needed to request PMI to be removed. I find Shellpoints response UNFAIR and ABUSIVE by telling me I need to payoff my loan. The HPA gives homeowners like me protections from these abusive practices. Is XXXX XXXX and /or Shellpoint sending denial letters like this to all senior citizens because our income is not likely to increase and they want to ensure theyre protected from potential loss if a foreclosure where to occur? This practice is predatory and violates any concept of Fair Mortgage Loan Servicing rules. 
Finally, Shellpoint is clearly violating XXXX XXXX Servicing Guide as it relates to termination. XXXX XXXX Servicing Guide, section B-8.1-04 states that PMI should automatically terminate for my single-family primary residence at 80 % LTV. Clearly, Im well below this requirement.

I am requesting the assistance of this regulator for two purposes. First, I would like my PMI terminated. Second, in accordance with HPA 4902 ( f ), I want a refund of all PMI premiums that I overpaid based on XXXX XXXX guideline of 80 % LTV. 
Also, I believe it would behoove the regulator to investigate the Fair Servicing practices of Shellpoint to determine if these unfair and abusive practices ( requiring I payoff my loan to get PMI removed ) and clear violations of HPA are targeted to senior citizens, a protected class of individuals. Also, has XXXX XXXX instructed its servicer to delay removing PMI in violation of HPA and its own Servicing Guide because Im a XXXX XXXX with limited income and they want to protect themselves from financial loss in the event of a foreclosure? 

Attached is the relevant sections of the HPA and XXXX XXXX Servicing Guide, and my denial letter from Shellpoint. Thank you for your assistance.

159,2023-04-14 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Summary of Complaint : My monthly payment on my new Truist mortgage increased from {$1300.00} in year one to {$1700.00} in year two. That is a 29.5 % payment increase on a fixed rate mortgage! Investigation indicates the Truist loan department entered a much less expensive, incorrect, homeowners policy insurance premium on the closing documents. When, the escrow was refigured a year later with the correct premium information, the combination of this, and an accumulated escrow shortage of {$3000.00} for XXXX, resulted in a much higher payment. 


Complete Narrative. In late XXXX, with interest rates low, I began the process of refinancing two properties. 

Property # 1 is my primary residence : XXXX XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX ) XXXX WV XXXX. Prior to the refinance, the mortgage lender on XXXX was BB & T. BB & T was in the process of transforming to Truist Bank at that time of my refinance. Since I had had good service from BB & T, I contacted the local branch mortgage broker, XXXX XXXX and gave her the first opportunity to make a proposal. XXXX was good to work with and we arrived at a proposed package without too much difficulty : {$210000.00} at a 2.99 % fixed rate over 20 years with approximately $ XXXX out. Then commenced the lengthy process of sending my financial information to the Truist mortgage officer, XXXX XXXX. Having been through the mortgage application process numerous times, I knew in advance what the process entailed and had most of my financial information well-organized in a digital folder on my computer. My application for a mortgage with Truist was eventually accepted and I received a closing disclosure that estimated monthly Principal & Interest at {$1100.00} and my estimated monthly payment at {$1300.00}. Based on this, I agreed to move forward, and we set a closing date of 1/20/2022.

Property # 1 has been insured by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) for many years. My homeowners premium on this property has hovered around $ XXXX. ( The property is in the woods far from town without fire hydrants available, hence the high premium ). 

Property # 2 is an investment property in North Carolina. It was refinanced with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, NC ) at the same time. Although my yearly insurance premium load is higher for this coastal property, the actual homeowners ( aka Hazard ) component of my package there XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) is {$830.00}. 

Imagine my shock at receiving the friendly email from Truist ( XX/XX/XXXX ) telling me my payment was increasing {$400.00} dollars per month. An immediate call to customer service ( XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX ) revealed the payment increase was due to the insurance going from $ XXXX to $ XXXX! This document is also included. 

Having retired in late XXXX, I am on a fixed income and trying to adjust my expenses so my savings will last me as long as possible. If I had known the payment was going to be so much more expensive, I would have opted for a 30-year term to keep my payment low. 

I have attached the closing documentation supplied by my closing attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX WV ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX XXXX who stated that the closing documents were generated at Truist. It matches the document recently sent to me by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and my copy received prior to closing. This document confirms that the amount entered for homeowners insurance was incorrect and indicates that whoever filled out the document at Truist entered the premium amount for property # 2 instead of that for Property # 1. Double checking my file of documents which I sent to BB & T/ Truist confirmed that I had sent them the correct Homeowners declaration page. The premium should have been approx. {$2600.00}. 

A few other salient points : Ironically, the original BB & T mortgage escrow document ( viewable online ) had the correct insurance information-down to the policy number! Why this was ignored is unknown. 

Customer service indicated I could request closing information documentation from the bank. When it finally became available online-after several weeks (! ) - the information was grossly incorrect : wrong loan amount, 30-year term, no money out. Go figure. 

I dont think this can be made right. My reason for filing this complaint is simply to alert other consumers that these kinds of mistakes can happen. Of course, one should expect ones monthly mortgage payments to creep up over time due to changing taxes and insurance premiums- but not by 30 %. ( Ironically, my real estate taxes on property # 1 went down in XXXX, due to a XXXX XXXX homestead exemption ). And, after the accrued escrow shortage is resolved, my monthly payment will be less, but it will be nowhere close to {$1300.00}. Again, I would have opted for a 30-year term if I had seen an accurate account of my monthly payment before closing. In discussions, both my attorney and local mortgage lender made the point that the principal and interest part of my payment had not changed- that the increase was totally due to the increased insurance payment, as though the bank did not play a role in the increase. To me, this is irrelevant- tell this to my checking account. 

Lesson learned : Buyer beware. Dont trust the bank to make sure the closing agreement is correct. Although I saw the premium information prior to closing, I wasnt quite sure what I was looking at, because the amount was prorated over less than a year. I should have followed up.

I have called, messaged, and filed the complaint with CFPB, as well as have contacted my Congresswoman, Senators and Governor. 

I am now having to speak with HUD and the Attorney General since I still have not gotten my modification paperwork after Bank of America had contacted me numerous times saying that I qualify for extra time on my COVID forbearance.

As of today XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX still have not been sent my modification options, nor the XXXX funds assistance information for the hardest hit homeowners.

The Commonwealth of MA has received approximately {$170.00} million in XXXX funding to prevent homeowner mortgage delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and displacements of homeowners experiencing financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. 

Why has Bank of America not overnighted the information that they promised regarding modifications? Why are they trying to force me to commit to payments resuming so soon on XX/XX/XXXX? I am currently protected by forbearance and previously had perfect payment history up until Covid crisis.

We are not sure with the sale of the property, why the recording of record is not sufficient. Please advise me if we are missing something. '' I called WFGLS and spoke with their Recording Manager, XXXX She does not believe it has to be re-recorded with the notary statement that was signed on XXXX. I told XXXX that I was directly instructed by the County Assessor 's Office and the County 's Title Section that WFGLS did not do the paperwork correctly and it needed to be refiled with the notary statement attached, per their instructions. I gave XXXX the telephone number for the person in the Title Section with whom I spoke. I 've checked back with the Title Section to see if XXXX has called him, but she has not done so. 
At this point, XXXX believes she knows more than the County Assessor 's Office and the County 's Title Section, and therefore she will not re-record the deed with notary statement. She was probably the person who decided in XXXX that the paperwork did not need to be corrected, which caused the XXXX property tax assessment letter. The Assessor 's Office will rescind the revised property tax assessment if WFGLS correctly attaches the notary statement with a new cover page to the XXXX paperwork.

Then, the taxes came out of the account and put us into a "" shortage ''. 

XXXX Received our escrow analysis from XXXX claiming we were in a "" shortage '' and that our payments would be increased from {$2200.00} to {$2300.00}. That would be an additional {$92.00} for the next 36 months to cover the shortage of {$3300.00}. 

XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Escrow Analysis arrives stating we are now short {$3700.00} ( MORE than last year 's shortage ) and our monthly payment will increase by {$150.00} a month for the next 24 months beginning XX/XX/XXXX. 
Brought our bill from {$2300.00} to {$2400.00}. 

XXXX XXXX received an email of the escrow analysis ( although we had received the one in the mail in XXXX ). The email contains a video presentation stating we are now {$5600.00} short in escrow and beginning XX/XX/XXXX our mortgage will be increasing to {$2600.00}. 
I reviewed our mortgage payment statement online. {$1000.00} a month goes into escrow. Our taxes every year are less than {$10000.00}. So if we are paying {$12000.00} into escrow a year, and taxes are only {$10000.00} ( which they haven't been that high yet ) ... why are we coming up SHORT? We are paying at least {$2000.00} extra into escrow. Why is our escrow shortage continuing to accrue a negative balance? And why does our mortgage continue to increase, although we are already paying to cover the shortage? 
Please help! We are paying what they asked of us to cover the shortage AND our taxes... where is our escrow money going? How can they keep raising our payment by hundreds of dollars when they did the analysis and established the money needed to pay off the shortage and we are gladly paying it?

They will not communicate with me. I send electronic messages through their website with no response other than the auto generated we have received your request. Same thing with postal mail. I get a letter that states my request has been received and will be answered in 30 days and after the XXXX days I just get another letter stating the same thing. I call the phone number and the person that answers tells me I have to speak with my assigned account representative and transfer me to said person whos name changes very frequently and I get voicemail every time. I leave messages with no return phone call. I submitted via their upload option an application for loan modification in XXXX with XXXX response. Strangely when I try to use the complaint system it gives an error and will not let me hit send. I have screenshots of all that has occurred on the website and voice recapturing a of all of my transfers to voicemails. I live in Louisiana and in XXXX after no phone calls again. I drove to the address on my bill in XXXX XXXX South Dakota and the building is deserted. I will include the transcript of the chat I had with them concerning this. I am also receiving letters stating my escrow account is in the negative and I need to pay thousands funny thing is I dont have an escrow account. I next got a letter stating that was a mistake only to once again get another letter that my escrow was behind. I fell behind due to a combination of the death of my spouse and job lay-off. During the entire time which started in XXXX I made a payment every XXXX days without fail. I just could never catch up the ones that were behind. So in XXXX of XXXX they offer me a loan modification and the loan XXXX who I spoke with on a weekly sometimes daily basis for 5 months instructed me over and over not to make my monthly payment because it would help to indicated my hardship and increase my chances of being approved for the XXXX modification. I expressed my concern about this several times only to be reassured that even if my application was not approved I would have other options and would not be expected to come up with any lump sum of money. I have recording of these conversations as well. Application was denied and I got a letter stating I had 30 days to come up with XXXX dollars. When I call to talk to the loan XXXX who promised this would not happen I was told he no longer worked there and we are so sorry but he advised you wrong. So off to an attorney my account went and the total amount I now owed was XXXX dollars. So I pooled every resource I had and took the money to an attorney in XXXX of XXXX told me I would be receiving a refund for them not having to pay to advertise my property and also for not paying the typical fees for sheriff sale. He said to expect around XXXX XXXX dollars back The paperwork stated this amount was to bring my account current through XXXX I was told my regular payments would be due on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX and my loan maturity date was XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. I might should have started with my ex husband was an XXXX and this loan is for a single wide trailer bought new in XXXX valued around XXXX ; XXXX. Financed at 8 % interest FOR XXXX FREAKIN YEARS! So I assure you I have more than paid for my home. So XXXX comes along and I go to my online account only to find it states my payments are behind What????? How can this be. I also see that there are unapplied funds on my account for around XXXX. The next day i call to discuss this I am told that the XXXX payment was never made. So here we go again. I ask about the extra money on my account and I am told I need to contact the attorney. I have request over XXXX times by phone and mail for a detailed statement of what my XXXX dollars was applied to and I want more of an explanation than attorney fees. And there are insurance disbursements for crazy amounts all the time. I have screenshots of that as well. I am just at a loss I have considered an attorney but was told the mtg company just filed bankruptcy so it wouldnt do much good. The only option to make payments is on ther website and it will only accept the full amount.

217,2020-12-03 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,None,"My home equity loan was sold to FAY SERVICING in mid XXXX. I went to my bank XXXX XXXX and arranged a direct withdrawal as I do with most of my accounts. I also made provision for a principal curtailment of {$590.00} to be applied to the payments. 

About the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a financial advisor who advised me to invest in REAL ESTATE. He also advised me to stop the curtailment/ overage amount I paying towards my loan with FAY SERVICING and apply that money in Real Estate investing. I agreed. I decided to originate a loan to further pursue more real estate investing. 

My first stop was XXXX XXXX. I went here to ask them to overage I was paying to Fay Servicing. I thought that because they helped me set up this payment that they were going to help me remove the curtailment/overage. When I went to XXXX XXXX, the Customer Service agent told me that I will have to contact Fay Servicing to do that. I thought she was giving me a wrong information because it was XXXX that helped me set up the account. At some point the agent had to bring her back Bank Manager who had to explain to me that only Fay Servicing could help me with that. I also contacted a loan officer who told me that among other things, he needed my loan statement from Fsy Servicing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted FAY SERVICING FOR TWO THINGS 1. To ask them to stop my curtailment/overage amount I had added to my loan. 
2. To ask for a copy of my most recent account statement. 
I spoke to Mr. XXXX XXXX who agreed to help me with both issues. He later sent the statement but in the month of XXXX, the overage amount didn't change. ( exhibit 1, enclosed ) I called again in XXXX and spoke to another agent about removing the curtailment/overage amount. The customer service rep apologized when I informed her of my previous experience and promised that I will definitely see the correction in XXXX. I called several times in XXXX and spoke to different agents who assured me that the problem has been taken care of.. 

After all my attempts, I was shocked when my statement came for XXXX with no change. I made several calls again to Fay Servicing but now I am quite sure nothing was going to happen. I contacted XXXX XXXX to see what I could do. The customer service advised me to file a claim for the overage. 

In XXXX I filed a claim for the overage of {$590.00}. for both XXXX and XXXX. I filed for these two months because after ALL THE EFFORT I PUT IN MAKING SEVERAL CALLS TO FAY SERVICING IN XXXX, I COULD NOT EXCUSE THEIR LAXITY. 

Unfortunately the XXXX XXXX agent instead of filing the claim for the amount I requested {$590.00}, she filed the claim for the entire amount of {$2000.00}. As soon as I realized this error. I contacted XXXX and this error was corrected. 

However, by the first week of XXXX, Fay Servicing flooded my address with about nine ( 9 ) letters of NOTICE OFDEFAULT AND INTENT TO ACCELERATE. ( Exhibit 2 ) I responded to all nine notices with certified mail receipts informing them that it was their fault. I was SHOCKED AT HOW QUICK FAY SERVICING CAN ACT WHEN THEY THEY WANT TO BUILD A CASE AGAINST THE CONSUMER. In my response ( attached as Exhibit 3 ) I explained to them how their agents laxity and lack of professionalism caused the problem. 
Fay Servicing agents later called me and said that they had corrected the error and that my account is now in good standing. I called severally and verified that and they said all is good. My next statement came and showed the correct amount. I thought this is now behind me. 

Then yesterday XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter from Fsy Servicing where among other things, the agency is claiming that. 
1. The first time I called them to discuss removal of the additional principal curtailment was on XX/XX/XXXX. I informed them that this was a gross misrepresentation. My ( exhibit 1 ) bears witness to this fact.

2. That their history shows two NSFs were received on my account resulting in BAD CHECKS FEES BEING APPLIED TO MY LOAN. THAT THIS REFLECTS TWO LATE PAYMENTS WITHIN THR PAYMENT HISTORT. THEY WENT FURTHER TO SAY THAT FAY HAS REPORTED THIS LOAN AS CURRENT THEREFORE MY CREDIT REPORT HAS NOT BEEN IMPACTED. ( Exhibit 4 ) 3. They changed my payment amount. Charged me for NSF and BAD CHECKS and added extra taxes. My payment amount from XXXX moving forward changed. 

* THIS IS ROBBERY WITH PEN AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. IN THE LEAST, THIS IS FRAUDULENT. THIS IS WHY I HAVE DECIDED TO HAVE A NEUTRAL BODY INVESTIGATE THIS. 

I again responded with certified mails and pointed out that. 
1. I again narrated my ordeal with FAY SERVICING. I asked them to check their records and correct their gross misrepresentations. ( copy of my response is Exhibit 5 ) 2. I asked them to remove their NSFs and BAD CHECKS reports on my account Note* Fay Servicing is abusing their authority because they feel they can. I can not imagine how they have been malhandling people who can not express themselves. 
Any descent agency who sees how much I have tried will understand it is their fault and resolve this problem but Fay Servicing has continued to push the buttons. 

I also notice they that they get a kick out of destroying the lives of the consumers. Fay Servicing is one of the companies consumers refer to as BULLY COMPANIES. 

They feel so big and so untouchable that they don't even care what message they are se

nding across to their customers. Notice in the page 2 of Exhibit 4. Fay Servicing writes. "" if you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Account Manager, XXXX XXXX, at ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX. '' I have called this number more than 20 times without any response. I left messages but no body has called me back. Each time I call the voice message says that XXXX is out of her seat or with another customer but will return my call. 
Since yesterday no one has returned my call. Today XX/XX/XXXX, I made few more calls to that number but no luck. I believe this phone is just a front. 

Also, yesterday, I called their customer service line at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I got Ms. XXXX XXXX on the line. I explained my ordeal to her and she said she will speak to the Assistant President of the company and call me back. This is the second day, I am still waiting for that call. When I thought about the idea of a Customer Service agent having that casual access to the Vice President of a company, I realized she just wanted to just get me off the phone..

I asked for an escalation and was told a new loan department would look into it and to email documentation of payments I had made. Was told of 60 day protection, I explained that I only became aware of these overdue payments 47 days after the clock started since homepoint is showing that they had the loan since XXXX.

We have received and reviewed their response, including what appears to be fraudulent documentation, notably a customer initiated withdraw request. AT NO POINT DURING THE REFINANCE PROCESS INITIATED IN XXXX DID WE REQUEST A WITHDRAW. As indicated in our initial complaint and all conversations with Fifth Third we requested the loan process be continued. 

We are extremely dissatisfied not only with Fifth Third 's decision but are extremely disappointed that they would attempt to state we requested a withdraw. If they sincerely believed a withdraw request had been made we should have been contacted or received a copy of such a withdraw. Further, had such a request been made we believe it would have come up during discussions of our loan ; at no point during those discussions did anyone at Fifth Third disclose that such a request had been made. We would assume, that had such a request existed, that Fifth Third would have wondered why the customers continue to call inquiring about the loan and requesting updates as to its progress. All communications regarding this loan have requested that the process be continued and our incongruent with the current claim. It appears false documents have been created to support this false claim which is extremely disturbing. Fraudulent practices have no place any industry and we believe this must be investigated. 

We are requesting Fifth Third address this situation with the following pieces of information : 1. Who they claim made the request as well as associated date, time, and in what format.

2. Why we were not notified of a request being made in relation to our loan.

3. Why the form they have submitted is BLANK ( which is likely because no such request had actually been made ) 4.

We request an explanation of why the requests have been denied and the appeal process. Notably, why as current customers NO ONE from the company has returned our calls or attempted to communicate with us. We remind Fifth Third that we are CURRENT CUSTOMERS now with significant concerns regarding fraudulent activity on our account and request the curtesy of a phone call with an individual who will be able to facilitate an appropriate investigation.

We tried to get my loan to go through a bunch of different ways and the agents knew about this in full detail. 

I have not received my deposit back, neither agency will return any of my countless emails, calls, etc. This is is extremely unprofessional and unethical as they would call me constantly when it looked like they were going to make money off of me, but now that I need assistance with getting the money back ; which I am legally owed per the contract and the denial date, no one is communicating or helping me at all besides the lender.

I didn't want things to come to this, but something needs to be done. I don't think a phone call is too much to ask for and legally since the money should be returned to me, i don't see why they are avoiding this situation.

He made a couple of payments and then stopped paying his payments to us. We tried to work with him but he refused to pay any further and filed for bankruptcy. After several years of fighting in court with lawyer fees and lost time and interest, we were finally given a deed after the foreclosure sale on the second deed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We immediately contacted XXXX XXXX Bank to get a payoff figure so we could sell the house to recoup our retirement moneys. XXXX of the bankers told us that the figure should be about {$200000.00} dollars, but he could n't handle our situation, and referred us to other bankers who did n't help. The bank would not talk with us and just kept dragging it out month after month until finally XXXX of them told us that XXXX XXXX XXXX owned the note. They apparently bought it from XXXX as a Non Performing Loan for a fraction of the out standing balance, even though we were willing to pay off the whole balance due, well before XXXX sold it. We finally made contact with XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, ( and XXXX XXXX XXXX, who never got back to me as promised ), and made an offer based on what we had heard for XXXX about the amount of the balance owed. XXXX now wanted us to send certification of funds with our offer. This ties up our moneys as they would wait for weeks each time to "" hear from the investors '' about our offers. It has now been almost a year and a half they are still adding fees and interest and having us up our offer, they now say that the payoff is around {$290000.00}. This seems unfair. We feel like they are taking advantage of us because we are both seniors and not up on the most recent banking tactics and strategies. 

So we discovered how banks sell the NPLs to private investors who make huge profits at the foreclosure sales. We discovered that XXXX had actually sold the note to another bank while going through other questionable corporations. XXXX of the private LLCs was actually wholly own by the XXXX XXXX Bank. Then we discovered that RLM was actually the Attorney for XXXX. It all starts to look fishy and banks seem to be colluding get these homes. In this process we discovered that after we notified XXXX that we wanted to pay off the First Loan on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, they quickly sold the note to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Why the rush to sell this note when we were trying to pay it off. Then we discovered that XXXX had sold the same note to MTGLQ Investors, L.P. on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, over a month before they actually owned it. They tried to hide this problem by recording the deeds out of order, but the Execution Dates are clear on XXXX deeds. MTGLO is apparently owned by Goldman Sachs Bank. There have been lawsuits with these banks for not having the loan documents handled correctly. So, what are a couple of senior citizens supposed to do against the power of the big banks, especially when there are shady practices going on with these documents? 

We do n't mind the banks making a rightful and legal profit. But this seems to be an illegal practice to squeeze out an excessive and unfair profit by not dealing in good faith and adding interest and fees continuously, long after we had tried to pay off the original note, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

At the time Mr. XXXX told me that he was extremely busy running the company on his own being that his wife was set to XXXX XXXX  any day, and that he can not run and jump every time the bank called him. He seemed to be very frustrated with the entire process. I have attached the Verification of employment that he completed early XXXX.

I had provided my paystubs every two weeks and around XX/XX/XXXX I received a request to provide my W2 from XXXX XXXX XXXX along with a local address. Nation One was aware from the beginning that my employer was in XXXX, Oregon. I had also advised the processor that I hadnt received my W2 from XXXX XXXX XXXX yet. The processor spoke with my boss again inquiring about the W2 he stated that he can provide a work ledger and they stated that will suffice. On XX/XX/XXXX Nation One Bank gave me until end of business day for my employer to provide the work ledger or that my loan would be dead. My realtor as well as I reached out to my employer numerous times via phone and email for him to provide the work ledger. He finally responded to my numerous calls about XXXX eastern standard time. At this point Nation One had advised my realtor the deal was dead. I was terribly upset and frustrated at this point because I had been trying to reach out to my boss all day. Once we finally spoke, we had a huge argument regarding the way he has handled getting my lender the proper paperwork. We had a very heated argument over the phone and fired me over the phone and sent me the work ledger the following day. As soon as I received the ledger, I forward the ledger to my realtor and Nation One Bank who was still giving me an extremely hard time about the ledger. Nation One bank advised that they received the ledger but that it needed to be sent from the employer directly and needed my last paystub. I advised my agent that I wanted to move on from Nation One bank because they were putting me through the ringer to get my loan approved. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I moved on to XXXX XXXX  with XXXX XXXX as my loan officer. My agent informed the previous lender that we were moving on and that the new lender will request the FHA Case Number.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I also contacted the attorney that was provided in their documentation and left a VM. after 24 hours I attempted to call the attorney again on XX/XX/XXXX with no response. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the number again with the attorney ( Left VM ) and with the Mortgage company. ( No VM available ). I looked up the Mortgage co main number and dialed in that way. On this day she understood we were trying to resolve this and that she would reach out to that attorney directly and see what was going on. I was also given a new number for that Attorney 's office at that time. 

Contacted the new Attorney number and left another VM. 

At this point, we were rolling into the weekend. I gave it a couple of days in between to allow a return call. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with the mortgage company again asking why can I not get ahold of them. The mortgage company sent out an email ( XX/XX/XXXX ) directly to the attorney requesting the reinstatement themselves and noted that the email was opened by the attorney and should hear something within 1-2 days. She also stated that the deadline for Mod assistance dated XX/XX/XXXX is voided as the circumstances with the discovery of a resolution could not be determined due to lack of info being provided. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked up a general number for the attorney hired by the company. Spoke with a receptionist and was given yet a third number. Called and left another VM. 

At this point, I have not received any other documentation, contact, calls, demand letter, reinstatement total, or anything in regard to a resolution. I also raised questions with the escrow account along with the money held in suspense that I was paying extra towards the loan to catch up It wasn't until XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reinstatement response from their attorney and continued to bill during this time. I requested an Itemized billing by date with every action they have taken and also request a meeting with the attorney and accounting to determine why this is the first I am hearing from their offices and why they did not respond to the mortgage company. 

I was told by the attorney they continue until the Mortgage company says stop. 
I called the mortgage co back and spoke with someone new at this point. I was told those charges were incurred prior to my request. Then I reaffirmed that is not the case as I have an itemized billing from them disputing that allegation. 

At this point, each party was finger pointing and the attorney said I need to speak with the Mortgage co and the Mortgage co said I need to talk with their attorney. At this point, I had no choice but to resolve the amount stated as this put my career in question. 

I ended up paying the reinstatement amount, not because I agreed with it, but to protect my professional life. It was never an issue that the funds weren't available. 


My issues- There was no prior communication and the mortgage company is stating they did not have a good number, email, or mailing address for me. ( yes the mortgage company of the property had no address for me ). None of that info has changed in 5 years since I started dealing with the Mortgage company directly. 

I was told their system changes could have caused this issue, in turn, put the home into foreclosure and delayed any remedy. They did not comply with the fair dealings and good faith act on behalf of a mortgage servicer. 

After paying the reinstatement amount, I received another statement showing over XXXX owed when the same day, I received a reinstatement confirmation stating we are no longer in default and the reinstatement from the attorney showed all fees past and future for dismissal as part of the reinstatement amount. 

Receiving docs that were only good through the date it was printed and then mailed. 

The mortgage company in relation to the attorney they hired, did not give any notification, mishandling of information, admitted faults with their mailing, and still can not answer the questions raised on the escrow account. 

This was not a single misstep along the way but a combination of multiple actions or lack of action that has warranted seeking action. This was an intentional delay and foreclosure of the home and then continued to make it impossible to resolve for months on end. 

This has not only caused more of an unnecessary financial burden but the hours on the phone with them and the emotional strain through the holidays and months on end. 

and continuing to prove a financial burden being accumulated after an agreement was reached.

325,2020-05-01 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a letter to the Department of the Treasury 's Office of Thrift Supervision to request its assistance with ongoing problems that I have been having with my mortgage company, Specialized Loan Servicing. The company has created an  escrow account in my name and is charging me for hazard insurance, which I currently and have always had. I have owned my home for 17 years and have always maintained a hazard insurance policy for my home. I absolutely do not need ( nor do I want ) Specialized Loan Servicing to provide me with a policy. I have repeatedly told them that I have a policy, but the company simply ignores me. It has added approximately {$150.00} per month to my mortgage payment, which is an amount that I absolutely refuse to pay because I maintain my own policy which is currently paid in full for the XXXX term. 

I contacted the Office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) on XX/XX/XXXX, to check the status of its progress with my complaint. OTS states that to date, it has no record of my complaint. The representative with whom I spoke suggested that the CFPB might be a better agency with which to file my complaint and suggested that I resend my letter to CFPB, so I have attached a copy of my original letter along with the documentation that was originally submitted with the letter. In the past, Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) also erroneously ( and I now believe deliberately ) claimed that my property taxes were delinquent and threatened to create an escrow account for my taxes. Again, there is absolutely no issue with my property taxes, so I have included the property tax issue in my complaint.

In my letter, I requested that Specialized Loan Servicing be censured and penalized for faulty record keeping. However, yesterday XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, I discovered information that leads me to believe that Specialized Loan Servicing should also be investigated for fraudulent business practices. 

A friend, who owns multiple rental properties, informed me that I could review my mortgage company 's business rating through a simple internet search. I was unaware that it was possible to obtain such information. I was appalled by the information that I discovered. A quick internet search uncovered numerous online complaints from individuals like me who were experiencing problems, such as mine, with Specialized Loan Servicing. There were complaints from other individuals who had also been forced by SLS to purchase hazard insurance, when they already had their own policies. There were others whose mortgage payments never posted to their accounts, so they were forced to make multiple additional payments simply to be able to access their accounts and hopefully receive assistance from SLS representatives to correct what they knew to be mistakes. There will still others who had been forced into foreclosure by SLS due to processing mistakes that the homeowners claim that SLS made. Like me, many of these individuals did not chose SLS as their mortgage lender, but rather had mortgages that had been sold to SLS by XXXX XXXX Bank. I recall the XXXX XXXX scandal from just a few years ago. Much of what I read about the XXXX XXXX fiasco sounds eerily similar to the online complaints from SLS customers that I recently discovered.

I visited the XXXX  website and discovered that the XXXX  given Specialized Loan Servicing a rating of either F or NR for "" No Rating '' because the XXXX  refused to rate Specialized Loan Servicing. To date, XXXX  has received more than 600 complaints from homeowners regarding their problems with SLS. I do not understand how such a company can be allowed to operate. For this reason, I implore you to not only assist me in resolving my complaint, but to also investigate SLS 's business practices. 

I have included copies of internet searches and the XXXX  rating that I discovered for your reference. I am hopeful that this information will prove useful in resolving my complaint and investigating the complaints made by others.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Specialized Loan Servicing Holdings LLC,MD,21133,None,1,Web,2020-05-01 00:00:00.000000,Closed with explanation,1,1,3633223,"[-1.5853813, -2.0261667, -1.9123658, -1.783003, -1.3601419, -1.2552708, -1.3922755, -0.9603512, -0.92885584, -1.0026718]"

335,2020-08-08 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"My complaint here pertains to a Wells Fargo conventional mortgage, myself and my partner are joint holders of this account. 

The complaint is about a XX/XX/2020 due payment that made on XX/XX/XXXX which was incurred due to Wells Fargos own failures Ive tried to ask WF to  remove this late payment, but to no avail. 
I own several XXXX  dollars worth of properties and this late payment has plummeted my perfect credit score and has effectively ended my ability to run my real estate investment business. 


HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED. 
On XXXX, unbeknownst to me Wells Fargo disengaged the autopay I had setup without reason. 
Although later WF acknowledged the auto pay was dis-engaged, they claim that I did so, whereas I did never authorized the autopay to be disengaged online or by phone. 

I decided in XX/XX/XXXX to make an extra payment on my account, thinking I have the auto pay setup that the XXXX payment would come out automatically. However the XXXX payment was never processed and I was not been made aware of this until XX/XX/XXXX, when I saw my credit score plummet. 

ERRORS & VIOLATIONS WELLS FARGO HAS COMMITTED 1. I Never  Disengaged The Auto Payment : WF claims I had disengaged the auto payment, but I never authorized its disengagement by phone or online.

2. WF Sent Statements To The Wrong Address : WF claims the delinquency notices that are required to be mailed by law were sent XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX ( the subject property address ), whereas this was never supposed to be my mailing address. 

Prior to this I had tried multiple times with WF to change the mailing address to where I live at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX MA XXXX, by phone and online. However evertyime I tried to change it online WF online system gave me an perplexing error of invalid email address.

3. WF Was Calling an Incorrect Ph # Which I never Gave them In my conversation with WF, they claimed they called me multiple times at a XXXX phone #. I have never had a XXXX phone # and definitely never gave them this number. 
This is further proof that WF has mixed up my contact information with another customer. 


4. No Way of Retrieving Mailed Notices : In addition, there was no way of me getting the mailed notices since there was a natural disaster declared. In MA where I lived as well as in Florida ( please refer to natural disaster declaration below 5. Natural Disaster Declaration ( see Attached FEMA declaration ) There was a FEMA declared natural disaster declaration issued for the address where my property was located, these are grounds for late payments not to be reported by FCRA regulations 6. Failure To Mark Account Affected by Natural Disaster and COVID related issues WF was required by the FCRA to mark that the account was affected by Natural Disaster, this was never done. The entire country was shut down due to COVID. WF has issued many people deferments due to this.

7. More than Enough Money in Bank Account for WF to Withdraw Payment ( see attached bank statements ) I use a dedicated XXXX XXXX XXXX bank account for all accounts I have on auto pay. This account had more than enough funds in my bank account for the mortgage payment of {$1200.00} to be paid. This clearly proves this was not a case of me not having enough funds to pay.

- The lawyer XXXX XXXX testified in court that my note was miss placed and they had now-hereabout of it.If the note is lost and I have the pooling of mortgage in XXXX XXXX. Then, who is my investor? I called the bank they told me the same thing. 

AS you can see there is lots of fraud in my loan. I do not want to use it to get a free house. I just want reasonable modification. No predatory modification.

PennyMac has been trying to Foreclose on my home and has been for the past three years, stating I am 1300 days plus past due. When I purchased home, the loan officer made false claims on the application, and my Relator and the sellers did NOT disclose information about the property ; if they did, FHA would not have approved. There is thousands of dollars in hidden fees and many other fees that I have been trying to dispute. Due to financial hardship less than a year after buying I applied and was approved for HAMP in XXXX. At time of hardship modification, the 30 year FIXED APR at 3.75 % increased to 4 % with FHA hardship ( All FHA guideline and regulatory requirements states interest rates will not change with a modification unless the are decreased and can be dropped as low as 2 %, never had I found where and FHA loan modification interest rate can be INCREASED. Also I had to file bankruptcy in XXXX, and while in bankruptcy ( chapt  XXXX ) PennyMac   charged bankruptcy fees property inspection fees foreclosure fee title fees you name it, The fees totaled together add up to $ XXXX plus dollars, plus the increase in interest rate. While a person is in bankruptcy they legally can not be charged any fees. In XXXX, the bankruptcy lawyer was able to get PennyMac to reverse around {$6000.00} in fees. The fees continued, and for reasons that are not known to me ( with evidence to support my statement ) the bankruptcy was dismissed in XXXX ; PennyMac called me before I received any legal notice about the Chapter  XXXX dismal ; asking how I planned to pay {$18000.00} within 10 DAYS, I replied that I was paying the trustee to pay arrears and making payments on my own that were to go to current loan ( not arrears, which was court orders ), therefore any and all payments since XX/XX/XXXX ( bankruptcy filed ) PennyMac states no payments ever received. Life happened and I have a dependent ( which I have not been able to get the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to ever enforce in 8 years ) and lack of involvement and the abuse I have to endure when trying to communicate with the other parent of my dependent has lead me to not be able to work many times, and I have a XXXX, XXXX with certifications, and 10 years XXXX XXXX XXXX. Due to my credit, bank accounts being hack, information data BREACHES ( not one but a few ) and PennyMacs   HARD Inquiries and reporting failure to make payments when I and trustee where paying, has ruined my credit! I know the EEOC states its illegal to discriminate hiring a candidate based off credit ) but many company look at the credit in their background reports, and this is the only reason I can think of as to why its been so hard for me To find a good XXXX job! Last years when my EIC was ONLY {$16000.00} total for XXXX, I was Seeing work and receiving unemployment which I had to appeal 3 times, but DID finally win and had to win to receive financial assistance through the XXXX XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX unemployment bridge program. I was awarded ( and have the award letter and ALL correspondence to prove everything I am stating ) {$15000.00} ( maybe {$18000.00} ) via this programs. However, the state of Kentucky, said PennyMac only would accept PAY-inFull! Well this is the problem, I DO NOT KNOW, how much I REALLY OWE due to the fees, not applying payments properly, increase interest rates, etc. I was then advices to hire a Lawyer who charges $ XXXXhr and has not been of any help, but costing thousands. After being summons foreclosure papers again, the lawyer advised me in XXXX to go forthwith this new modification program offer, and make my 3 trial payments and in time! Which I did, and have all that evidence too! This new possible modification papers I was sent I did not agree with and asked to appeal and PennyMac representative XXXX told me it would not help me or change anything to try to appeal. So I passed that information onto the Lawyer I hired and he told me to go ahead and sign and make those 3 payments. I did as directed, PennyMac  even had me pay and extra $ XXXXmonth ; to receive a letter stating, I DO NOT QUALIFY! My concern and issue is ; PennyMac is not offering any help, the state of Kentucky is not helping, I am in a terrible situation and this is only making it worse and to the point of affecting my employment.

Unknowingly they have a place to pay on a defunct MORTGAGE that has been closed for someplace around 14 years. ( WHY IS A PAID OFF MORTGAGE EVEN AN OPTION? ) The available balance on that account is {$2700.00} which is approximately what the available balance is on the credit card we were trying to pay so it makes sense that would be the proper credit card account. Why would a defunct mortgage account even have an available balance amount and if so it would be in the hundreds of thousands balance available, not {$2700.00} This caused us to pay {$120.00} on the wrong account. If you enter the dollar amount you want to pay in the blanks provided it doesn't say this account is a Mortgage at any time, but if you click on the word Bank of America on the left side there is a splash screen that shows mortgage off to the side. Unfortunately this splash screen shows for less than a second. BUT SINCE THAT ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PAID OFF FOR APPROXIMATELY 14 YEARS WHY IS IT STILL ON THE BILL PAYING PROGRAM? 

They took our payment and credited it to a nonexistent mortgage and then sent us an email telling us our credit card account was past due and charging us a {$35.00} late fee. We immediately paid the bill ( again + the next month 's payment ) and they told us we'd have to call the mortgage department to get our money back. 

The mortgage department won't talk to us because we can not furnish an old account number, but after a search they said our mortgage had been paid off so long they can't even find it in their system. 

It has taken us all of XXXX and all of XXXX to get to point of filing a complaint. 

We have made multiple 45minute to an hour long phone calls getting the same runaround and today we went into the Bank and had a bank officer XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX, Texas branch attempt to walk us through the process and after another hour call he finally got the mortgage department to say they would refund our money, but by mail only as they couldn't find an account and their system was different from the banks so couldn't refund it through the bank. The lady checked their records and said that a letter had gone out in XXXX so we could expect our money within a week. 

When we got home we discovered that letter was received today, but it wasn't a check, it was a letter stating they were going to investigate it. 

Then to add insult to injury the bank refused to refund our late fee and change the credit records because it was our fault that we'd clicked on and paid an account that shouldn't have been on the bill pay system at all. 

So not only did they accept payment on a mortgage that doesn't exist and so far we've been unable to get them to refund our money, but they've also... 

Charged us a late charge when we were making a payment in good faith to a flawed BofA payment system which would make it their fault not ours Plus they are reporting us as a 30 day late to the credit bureaus on an otherwise spotless credit report. 

And they are obfuscating the process and making it unnecessarily hard for people to get BofA 's misteaks corrected. 

At XXXX point we just wanted to get our money back, have them refund the late fee and correct the credit bureau, but now we feel they should also pay for the time and effort we've had to put into this.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",TX,76020,Older American,1,Web,2023-03-09 00:00:00.000000,Closed with monetary relief,1,1,6673216,"[-2.3177776, -2.095184, -2.2409346, -2.0046668, -1.6457268, -1.3620933, -1.0266807, -1.2293961, -0.5701059, -1.2720932]"

Upon which Bank of America and its officers failed to disclose, falsified, concealed, and covered up by a trick material facts. As the Grantor/Trustor and beneficiary, I believe the mortgage fraud behavior and actions that Countrywide home loans now Bank of America was fined for years ago continues. I have attached an Affidavit in support of my claims. 
1. Bank of America have refused to investigate my ( consumer 's ) claim of discrepancy in billing errors and accounting statements, thereby willfully failing to comply with its duties under 15 U.S.C. section 1681 and 15 U.S.C. section 1681 ( n ). 
2. Bank of America failed to disclose to me the ( consumer ) that if/when the consumer exercises the right of rescission, not only does the mortgage that secured the credit transaction become void, the lender is required to return any money or property given to anyone in connection with the transaction within twenty ( 20 ) days. This noncompliance violates the technical rules laid out in Regulation Z of the Truth in Lending Act and decided by United States Supreme Court Justice XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX in the case [ XXXX Countrywide home loans, Inc., et al. 
3. Countrywide Home Loans now Bank of America has received full payoff of the debt and the noticed debt is now incorrect. Bank of America does not own the debt and therefore do not have standing to proceed with a non-judicial foreclosure. 
4. I entered into a closed end credit transaction home purchase mortgage and executed a Promissory Note at the day of closing in favor of Countrywide Home Loans and brokered by XXXX XXXX in XXXX Georgia for the property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Georgia XXXX. After consummation, the title to the property was never delivered to me by Countrywide Home Loans or presently Bank of America. 
5. Countrywide Home Loans now Bank of America and its officers I believe willfully and knowingly failed to disclose clearly and conspicuously before or at closing on the closed end transaction that the Note I executed was in fact a monetary instrument payable on demand for the property i purchased and the title to the property was to be pass and delivered according to Law 31 C.F.R. 103.11 ( u ) ( iii ) and UCC 3-108. 
6. This non-disclosure of aforementioned and concealing is an act of "" uninformed use of credit '' and violates the hypertechnicality standard under the Truth in Lending Act. 
7. In or around XXXX XXXX XXXX, I mailed and notified Countrywide Home Loans with a notice of rescission letter exercising my right of rescission informing the Bank above that I was rescinding the credit transaction mortgage pursuant to Law 12 C.F.R. section 226.23 ( a ) ( 2 ). However Countrywide Home Loans/Bank of America refused to acknowledge the Truth in Lending Act 's rescission rights and the UCC 's monetary instruments payment validity. 
8. I believe once I as a consumer rescinded the transaction, the security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void. In addition, I was no longer liable for any amount including any finance charge pursuant to Law 12 C.F.R. section 226.23 ( d ) ( 1 ).

415,2023-03-14 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Selene Finance sent us a Loan Modification Agreement dated XX/XX/XXXX. The Agreement reflects an Unpaid Principal Balance of {$450000.00}. We believe this amount is erroneous, as set forth below. Supporting documents are attached. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we entered into a Loan Modification Agreement with the previous lender, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Pursuant to this agreement, the Principal Balance of the loan was {$410000.00}. Of that amount, {$54000.00} was moved to the Deferred Principal Balance. The Principal Balance was reduced from {$410000.00} to {$360000.00}, with a Deferred Balance of {$540000.00}. 

Due to our income being reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we entered into a Pandemic Relief Plan offered by XXXX XXXX. Pursuant to this plan, our monthly payments, including principal, interest, and escrow, were paused from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX, for a total of XXXX payments. Pursuant to the Pandemic Relief Plan, these payments, in their entirety, including principal, interest, and escrow, were moved to the end of the loan. Thus, these payments, totaling {$45000.00}, were moved to the Deferred Balance. 

From XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX, we made a total of three payments, in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. We also made four payments of {$3900.00} to Selene, in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, which were the trial payments related to the loan modification. The total of these XXXX payments is {$23000.00}. The rest of the payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX were deferred under the Pandemic Relief Plan. All of the missed payments, including principal, interest, and escrow, were simply moved to the end of the loan. Thus, the total balance should not have increased. We did not receive any new money. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, our total balance owed was {$410000.00}. We made seven payments totaling {$23000.00} ( three payments of {$2400.00}, and four payments of {$3900.00} ), and 18 payments were moved to the end of the loan, and thus are still included in the {$410000.00}. Yet, as of XX/XX/XXXX, Selene is telling us our total balance is now {$450000.00}. Thats an increase of {$43000.00}, with no explanation. That amount is not interest, because the interest payments we missed during COVID are included in the Deferred Balance. Further, Selene concedes, in its letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that amounts in the Deferred Balance do not accrue interest. 

We sent a Qualified Written Request to Selene dated XX/XX/XXXX, outlining this and other errors by Selene. Selene responded by letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, received by us on XX/XX/XXXX. Selene conceded this response was late. With respect to the above error, Selene stated that it is under no obligation to respond to certain inquires [ sic ] contained in the letter, and thus did not explain the additional amounts charged. Selene can not be allowed to charge us {$43000.00}, and then claim they are under no obligation to tell us what those charges are. 

Additionally, we have requested, on multiple occasions ( including XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), a copy of the original note for this loan, front and back. Selene will only send us a copy of the front. This loan has been sold twice, and the endorsements are on the back. We believe we are entitled to see the back of the note. 

Selenes stated deadline to execute the Loan Modification Agreement was XX/XX/XXXX. We were told by a Selene representative, by telephone, that Selene would work with us on that deadline. However, we did not receive the response to our QWR until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, we requested an extension of time to execute the Loan Modification Agreement, as we were reviewing the response to our QWR, and Selene had told us they would work with us on the deadline. However, by letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Selene denied our request for an extension, telling us the documents must be returned by XX/XX/XXXX, which is of course impossible, as that date had already passed. 

It must be noted that we began the process of applying for a loan modification in XX/XX/XXXX, when we were three payments behind. Selene continued to request more documents from us, or would call without leaving a message, so we did not know they wanted more documents. When they claimed our loan modification application package was incomplete, on multiple occasions, they would deny it, and we would have to start over. We sent a total of four full application packages before Selene would finally review it and approve it, in XX/XX/XXXX. Since our understanding was that our monthly payments were paused during the application process, we did not make payments, believing, each time we sent an application, that our application was being reviewed. Because of this delay in Selene reviewing our loan modification application, we fell further behind in our monthly payments. 

It should also be noted that we had to send our QWR twice because the address on the Selene website is wrong. We did not know for weeks that it was not received. We also had to resend our first loan modification trial payment because that address on the Selene website also was wrong. The first payment was by cashier 's check, so we had to withdraw the money from our account twice in order to pay Selene ( both payments were properly credited ). 

In sum, Selene has committed the following errors with respect to our loan : XXXX. They did not timely respond to our QWR, in violation of RESPA. 
2. When they did respond, they did not explain the {$43000.00} in additional money charged to our account, claiming they are under no obligation to do so.

3. They refused to extend the deadline for executing the Loan Modification Agreement, despite telling us they would work with us in that regard. 
3. They have failed, after multiple requests, to send us a copy of the back of our original note, showing the endorsements.

We are requesting that Selene : ( 1 ) remove the excess charges from our account balance, up to and including {$43000.00}. To the extent any additional charges are reasonable and allowed by law, Selene should itemize and explain those charges, as we are entitled to know what we are being charged for. 

( 2 ) provide us a copy of the back of the original note related to this loan.

( 3 ) revise the Loan Modification Agreement in accordance with the above, and resend the documents to us for execution.

At that time the application was processed over the telephone about how much I made a year and general debts and my credit was pulled. I was then advice to work on my credit by getting a secured credit card and then they will pull my credit again and then proceeded asking me to send information about my XXXX, recent pay stubs, bank statements and retirement information. Then after information was gathered my employment was verified. I assisted with providing the information about my employment and both jobs were verified. Im a XXXX and it was explained at the start of the application that I just started working at a new job in the same field as a XXXX  and had been working full time hours with my agency and was not working there at the time of the application but was part of my income this year and I pick up hours as needed because Im a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was told they would work on trying to use that income but had already prequalified me based on all the debt I given them and my income from my full time job and what I made this far at my XXXX XXXX XXXX. After gathering all my information in XX/XX/XXXX, they asked me for updated pay stubs and was I still working at my second job and my employer stated I did and I explained via email conversation that was true but only worked per diem and due to mandated court counseling sessions from a previous family issue I was not picking up shifts in a phone conversation with XXXX the loan processor because I also made him aware that I had to use savings for legal fees and he said that shouldnt be an issue. They proceeded to have me change my student loan payments from income based to 300 month payment and take disputes of my credit report. I continued to ask about where we were with the status of the loan that I received a commitment letter stating all I needed to do to close on this loan was sell my house which my contract with the builder was based on contingency of my Home selling. Mind you this was the builder preferred lender I was told to use in order to receive financial assistance with closing. After providing the lender with updated pay stubs, they never once explained to me that they couldnt proceed with the loan due to my income was not enough. However they did proceed to tell the realtor for the builder that there was nothing else needed but a second verification of my employment. The problem did not arise until I had an offer on my home to sell and I needed confirmation that I had the loan and the question arised if my income had changed because an updated pay stub showed a different pay rate which I explained was payment for computer orientation hours as an employee we get paid at the rate for orientation and not our regular pay rate and then the issue was well we can not use this income because you have not worked at this job for over two years part time and this conversation is now happening in XX/XX/XXXX and when all my employment information had been provided since XX/XX/XXXX up to XX/XX/XXXX. The lender cant bsck stating I would have  to pay off my car which I have only been financing for less then two years, giving me the option to sell my car I had XXXX left to pay and be upside down with not enough money to pay back the car loan and also my house still had not been sold and the lender was depending and new I needed the proceeds of the house to aid in closing cost. I asked the lender why was I just being told this so far in the process where the house had now been completely build. The lender stated they had been having issues verifying my employment and trying to get the second income used. I explained to the lender that there was no way to pay off my car at this time and that my contract was contingent on my house selling and at this time the offer had fell through. I told the lender that there was nothing they could do for me at this time if my house didnt sell because I would be depending on the proceeds to move forward and I wasnt considering selling my car. So from there the realtor begin to get involve trying to convince me to sell my car and I told them that wasnt possible that was my ride back and forth to work and they told me I could get another one after closing. I then explain haw can closing happen when my current home was not under contract and have not sold. They later expressed that they would be terminating my contract and I agreed if we couldnt move forward and requested my earnest money back since they couldnt wait on my house selling. The seller stated that it was my fault the loan did not go through because I lied about my income and they would not be giving me my money back. I then tried pleading my case asking to speak to the manager and the seller had decided to go off what the lender had provided in why I wasnt going through with the loan. I explained everything I have written in this complaint and also stated how could I have lied when I have been mislead with my credit being pulled over more than five times and my employment being verified with recent pay stubs submitted and then later told five months into the loan process that they could not use my second income because I had not worked there as part time for two years but have been employed with them for over five years. I explained and felt it was unreasonable and I did my due diligence my providing every documentation asked for and change student loan terms and that I supposedly lied and now because the lender has not processed my loan because my debt to income is high with just using my full time income I cant purchase the home and mind you I wouldnt been able to until my current home sold but the builder is holding my earnest money because the lie was told by the lender that I lied about my income. At the end of it all, the lender stated I couldnt use my second income and I didnt want to be going back and forth this late in the process with the loan processor and told him if he said I couldnt use it then so be it, I guess so and this is whats suppose to make me a liar because he didnt figure out all the information Ive provided on my income would not be able to be use and now Im getting penalized for this lender mistake for not doing his due diligence.

Issue # XXXX : My husband was labeled a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX veteran and we contacted the mortgage company immediately to ask what steps needed to be taken since they would no longer need to collect property tax. We sent all requested documentation and had to contact them numerous times to get an early escrow evaluation to adjust our payments. This finally took place in XXXX ( 4mo of almost weekly phone calls with documentation exchanges, etc ). At that time they still insisted on collecting money for property taxes even though we had given multiple documents from the VA and county indicating we would not be paying them moving forward. Finally in XX/XX/XXXX, our regularly scheduled escrow analysis has our payment corrected. We have asked for our escrow account to be closed since we now only have to pay for home owners insurance and can do that on our own, but have been told multiple excuses for why we can't do this ( ranging from the length of the loan to the type of loan we have-it 's a new excuse every time we call ). 

Issue # XXXX : I had input my checking account information into their payment system and was having payments withdrawn on a monthly bases. In XX/XX/XXXX, my regular payment amount was withdrawn from my bank account twice. There was no evidence of this double withdrawal in New Rez 's system and they insisted that I "" take it up with my bank ''. I did as requested and continued to stay in close contact with NewRez as my bank had a multiple day hold before they could execute this. Finally the charge reversed ( still showing no evidence of the issue on NewRez 's account ). Then several days later, I received a second credit in my checking account, but still no evidence of any of this on my mortgage website or on any of my statements. We waited for the account to recognize the error and just held the payment in our account knowing that if we sent it in before a payment was shown to be due, it would be applied as an extra payment and we wouldn't get credit for the one that was due in XXXX. We had the aforementioned analysis on the account done in XXXX and XXXX and they still did not show the payment reversal. While I was on the account looking for the XXXX escrow refund, I noticed XXXX account activities dated XX/XX/XXXX. I called and the representative insisted that my XXXX payment had been reversed. I repeatedly insisted that this had not been the case and was once again told to "" take it up with my bank ''. I called back after speaking with my bank and was asked to provide evidence that this payment had not be reversed. It was then discovered that this reversal was related to the XXXX issue and instead of just requesting that payment be replaced, they had reversed and reallocated every single payment since XXXX and were now charging me late fees and showing late payments on my account. There has never been a single late payment and I have provided documentation of this. The missing XXXX payment has already been sent and documented in the account detail. We were told back in XXXX that this double payment issue was not isolated to our account-they had switched banks and apparently both banks withdrew from hundreds of accounts.

513,2020-10-31 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"This year we decided to research home loan refinance options and rates. After speaking with several different lenders, we selected a Loan Officer at Chase by the name XXXX XXXX. After speaking with Mr. XXXX  about our desire to obtain an APR of 3.000 % or lower, and pay no points, he promised us that he would not pressure us to lock-in a rate until we were satisfied with one that met our expectations. On XXXX XXXX, we applied for a loan paying {$500.00} application fee which was to go toward our closing costs. Mr. XXXX  consistently checked in with us and provided us with up-to-date interest rates. Each time he requested updated documentation from us, we quickly provided it to him.

On XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX, we received a voice message from XXXX XXXXl who identified himself as Mr. XXXX  manager. In the message he explained that our loan application had reached a point where we either needed to lock-in or cancel our application. We immediately called Mr. XXXX  to inquire about the voice message and to find out why the call was made. Mr. XXXX  was unaware that his manager had called and agreed to contact him to relay our initial loan expectations. On XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX, we received a second voice message from Mr. XXXX  requesting a call back to discuss our loan application. Shortly thereafter, Mr. XXXX  called and agreed to contact Mr. XXXX  again. The following day, XXXX XXXX, at XXXX XXXX, Mr. XXXX  left yet another voice message requesting that we return his call right away. We called Mr. Kyles and agreed to have a three-way call with Mr. XXXX  later that day. At XXXX XXXX, Mr. XXXX  called saying that Mr. XXXX  wanted to speak to us NOW. Mr. XXXX  said that the loan process had reached a point where he must get involved and he proceeded to pressure us, and what felt like bullying, telling us we needed to lock-in or withdraw our application. We asked why he was pressuring us and inquired about Chases lock-in policy. Mr. XXXX  only repeated that the loan had reached a point where we either had to lock-in or cancel. He threatened to cancel the loan if we did not lock-in by Friday of that week. We explained that we did not intend to cancel but wait for an interest rate that fit our expectations. We explained to Mr. XXXX  that if he needed to cancel our application ; we expect the application fee of {$500.00} to be refunded to us. He denied a refund but mentioned that if we applied again in the future, the fee would be waived. We expressed our displeasure about the company withholding the application fee since it was not our choice to cancel. Mr. XXXX  agreed to speak with his district manager to determine if a refund was possible. He provided us with another option, which was for us to obta

in three quotes from other banks so Chase could price-match ; however, that option came without a guarantee that the lower rate would be honored. Mr. XXXX  threatened to cancel the loan if we did not lock-in, withdraw, or provide quotes by Friday, XXXX XXXX. After our conversation with Mr. XXXX  on XXXX XXXX, we regretted that we entrusted Chase to handle our refinance transaction in an ethical and honest manner. We never imagined that our desire to have the best interest rate on our home would lead to being threatened and bullied. Furthermore, Mr. XXXX  did not wait until the 11th to relay more bad news. He and Mr. XXXX  called us again on the 9th, and Mr. XXXX  said that his supervisor denied our refund and that he would be cancelling the loan. Once again, we inquired about Chases policy on the time frame to lock a rate and no time frame was provided. Mr. XXXX  accused us of playing the market and even proceeded to give us a ridiculous analogy of going to a restaurant and not ordering anything. We requested the contact information for his supervisor, and he provided the name of XXXX XXXX, and a contact number of ( XXXX  ) XXXX. However, Mr. XXXX  did not hesitate to inform us that Mr. XXXX  was already aware of our case leaving us with the impression that no one was going to assist us with our refund request. On Friday, XXXX XXXX, Mr. XXXX  and Mr. XXXX  called, and Mr. XXXX  informed us that the loan was being cancelled and the application fee would be refunded. We asked Mr.
XXXX  to send us a confirmation email reiterating the conversation and asked him to acknowledge that it was not our decision to cancel the loan. He agreed to send the email and promised to do so immediately. One last time we asked Mr. XXXX for Chases policy about the time frame for locking an interest rate so we would understand the cancellation reason. At first, he did not give a definitive answer ; however, when we suggested that as a manager, he should know the banks policy, he finally told us 120 days. We had not yet reached 120 days, and this time limit was never disclosed to us prior. Mr. XXXX told us that he made a complaint on our behalf and when we asked if he included himself as part of the complaint, he told us he had. A curious statement he made out of the blue was to tell us that this would not affect our credit report. We are at a loss as to his meaning and the relevance, unless it was to instill fear of retaliation. As of XXXX XXXX, we have still not received the promised e-mail and/or refund, nor seen any complaint that Mr. XXXX  claimed to have made on our behalf.

On XXXX XXXX, we received a voice message from XXXX XXXX with Chase claiming to be responding to an e-mail she received from the lending manager XXXX. She requested a call back at ( XXXX  ) XXXX, ext. XXXX. That day, we made seven attempts and were unable to reach her. See attached call log.

On XXXX XXXX, we wrote a letter to Chase to file a formal complaint based on the unfair and disparate treatment we encountered with Mr. XXXX. And as a qualified written request for the refund of our application fee of {$500.00}. Mr. XXXX  last stated he was canceling our application and would refund our {$500.00}. We informed Chase in this letter that if we did not receive a response within 30 days, we would file a formal complaint with the CFPB. Our letter was sent Priority Mail on XXXX XXXX, and received by Chase in XXXX, Ohio on XXXX XXXX. See attached letter, and USPS Priority Mail Tracking.

After mailing our complaint, we have received two letters from Mrs. XXXX, one on XXXX XXXX, and the last on XXXX XXXX. These two letters refer to inquirys they received on XXXX XXXX, which were not from us.

On XXXX XXXX, we each received an email from : no-reply XXXX stating that our loan application documents will be available for the next 30 days. This is the only confirmation to us that our loan application was in fact cancelled by Mr. XXXX.

We would like to acknowledge Mr. XXXX  extreme professionalism throughout this entire debacle and are saddened that because of his supervisor, he was not able to complete our loan process or receive the monetary gain that comes with it.

In addition, it was noted by all parties on the call that : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to notify the PolicyHolder AND FREEDOM MORTGAGE of the CANCELLATION of the Policy until XX/XX/XXXX XXXX 9 months later ). 
2. Per the conversation it was agreed that FREEDOM MORTGAGE had the ability to overnight a check to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated that they needed to do further research. I was told that XXXX XXXX XXXX would contact either FREEDOM MORTGAGE Or me if additional information was necessary. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from FREEDOM MORTGAGE following up to see if the issue was resolved with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I informed FREEDOM MORTGAGE that no contact had been made. FREEDOM MORTGAGE advised me to continue attempting contact. 

On XX/XX/XXXX FREEDOM MORTGAGE sent me a letter requesting PROOF OF INSURANCE and advising that their records indicated FLOOD INSURANCE POLICY was expired. I contacted FREEDOM MORTGAGE in an attempt to follow up and was unable to reach the Insurance Department and instead had to re-inform a new person with FREEDOM MORTGAGE XXXX as he read the notes on the account ), however, he was unable to assist and was unable to contact the other member of his team. 
Upon review of the ANNUAL TAX AND INTEREST STATEMENT from FREEDOM MORTGAGE, there have always been sufficient funds in the ESCROW account to cover all taxes and Insurance policies for the mortgage of the property. 

I made several attempts to reach XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, with no success. 

Negligence by both Freedom Mortgage and XXXX XXXX XXXX and their disregard to take corrective action to a situation they have both created, leave me no other option. I have tried to communicate to no avail. This is an unnecessary hardship during very difficult and challenging times. I have spent hours going through cumbersome answering programs telling my story over and over. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, after multiple attempts to reach customer service at Freedom Mortgage, I was provided a link to upload proof of a new Flood Insurance Policy. On the XXXX, when I did not see my account updated, I called Freedom Mortgage again. The customer service rep was not looking at the correct account ( I have 2 ) and when I brought that to her attention she laughed and said "" ohhhh, that's probably what happened ''. 

I asked that payment be sent overnight. 

The next day on XX/XX/XXXX, I reviewed my escrow account to find an additional charge for a Flood Insurance Policy that Freedom Mortgage applied to my account without my knowledge or approval. 

I have called Freedom mortgage daily and have been unable to speak to anyone. Its either a dropped call or just a cycle of menus. 

Today XX/XX/XXXX I finally got through to another live person who told me that the charge is to cover the previous year XXXX. She stated that because I did not have coverage, Freedom Mortgage needed to apply it for me. I asked to speak to a Supervisor and there is NEVER one that is available. The customer service staff will do anything to keep you from speaking to anyone else. They always ask you to remain on the line while they look over your account. The customer service rep said that I can call XXXX. She said she submitted a request for a review on my account and someone should contact me by XX/XX/XXXX. In the meantime, my escrow balance is negative {$340.00}. Freedom Mortgage failed to notify me when they stopped payment on the Flood Insurance check. They did nothing to alert me knowing that Flood Insurance is a requirement on my mortgage. Now that I have provided them with proof they want to go back and charge me for coverage I did not have.

They also submit a credit correction on this day for XXXX installment that was missed. They did removed XXXX late charge totaling {$190.00}. I wrote a message to UWM in their messenger app regarding all of this as the agent advised this would be considered written notice. I received a message back I would have to write in to the company for any review to take place. The auto enrollment was again removed on XX/XX/XXXX because they said they couldn't find the account information. I enrolled in the auto draft AGAIN on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX day! On XX/XX/XXXX I was unenrolled again from auto pay and my credit correction was denied. I AGAIN tried to enroll in auto pay on XX/XX/XXXX and the same day made a payment of {$4400.00} and CONFIRMED my account information again with the phone agent! This agent told me to call back in XXXX to make sure the payment had gone through. XXXX days later on on XX/XX/XXXX I was UNENROLLED AGAIN and the payment I made on XX/XX/XXXX with the phone agent said the bank information could not be found and they tacked on another late fee ( {$190.00} ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I specifically asked this agent to make sure this payment went through and she said to CALL BACK IN XXXX. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and finally asked for a supervisor because at this point I have spent so much time trying to figure this out I was hoping a supervisor could figure it out! I was advised there was nothing they could do except verify the banking information again and I would have to write letters to the company which I did. I've spent hours on the phone, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, at home, etc contacting UWM trying to get this figured out. I have had multiple mortgages since XXXX and have not missed payments on any of them and have the capability to pay all my debts. I worked diligently on my end to try to make sure my servicer had the information they needed to receive payment. My only request is that the 30 day late payment on my credit report is removed. I have no issue paying all the late fees if that's what it takes even though I believe after the numerous times I was enrolled and XXXX enrolled and given bad information from representatives, I should not have to pay these. My credit is very important to me which is why again I have spent hours typing out all this information. I'm hoping you can protect the consumer and UWM will provide a credit correction due to the circumstances.

I have filed complaints in the past and US Bank gave back a little after I filled a complaint with you. I stared my loan modification with them back in XXXX. It ran on and on I complied with all their request. I finally gave up hires a lawyer and filled litigation against US Bank. Case #  XXXX in XXXX XXXX County. All seem good had a demure hearing scheduled XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. My lawyer failed to show we lost the demure hearing and US Bank immediately filed a Notice of Default against me. I was done with loan mods and lawyers, so I sold some of my retirement stock to get the money together to reinstate my US Bank loan. 
At that same time the world was hit with COvid-19 and US Bank sent out they would offer a temporary forbearance on payment because of the pandemic. I applied for the relief. Her on comes the first problem. 
1. First reinstatement figure was {$230.00} expired on XX/XX/XXXX the day I was released from the hospital 2. Second reinstatement figure was {$250000.00} Expired on XXXX XXXX at which time I ordered a demand to see why it was {$250000.00} to reinstate a loan with a balance of {$490000.00}. This is when I applied for the forbearance because of the pandemic. and I felt that would give me enough time to liquidate more assets to pay the extra {$19000.00} it had increased in 45 days. 
3. Got the money together finally and then I get an even higher reinternment figure of {$270000.00} that would be good thru XXXX XXXX After going thru that and watching it increase approximately $ XXXX a month I borrowed and sold everything I could and came up with the {$270000.00}.

I have sat on the phone for hours with them get transferred all over XXXX and nothing.

This issue is regarding our lengthy and unsuccessful efforts for correction of a major error in title that occurred at the closing of a refinance of our home in XXXX by XXXX  XXXX  and the bank at that time, WAMU. They failed in their duty to cause our new mortgage Deed of Trust to be filed in the Arizona XXXX County Recorders Office in valid 1st position, free from liens, encumbrances, easements, encroachments and other title matters as required by the Specific Closing Instructions of Chambers. They neglected to obtain the proper documents required and the previous loan was never released or closed. These failures created a chain of events that have resulted in catastrophic financial damage for us and could result in the loss of our home. 

XXXX  XXXX, in all documents ( see attached ) certified, and guaranteed they had obtained the Deed of Release and Reconveyance releasing the WAMU Deed of Trust and closed the account as requested in all closing instructions. In reality, these commitments were not fulfilled, leaving the old WAMU Personal Equity Manager Home Equity Line of Credit Agreement open and in 1st position. Over the years of the banking chaos and closures, that WAMU loan account resurfaced and has blocked our efforts of refinancing that would allow us to save significantly with lower interest rates. 

This error in title is causing devastating loss for us. We have fought this battle for years, since it was discovered in XXXX with our first failed refinance attempt since the XXXX XXXX refinance, but to no avail. Please refer to the attached supporting documentation and chronological list of events for a detailed description of what transpired. Please, review every detail carefully. We need your help. 

We have contacted all parties involved multiple times by phone, email, and correspondence. We filed appeals with XXXX XXXX/XXXX ; they are unwilling to assist us stating the Title Policy we purchased only protects the lender, not the borrower. Our mortgage company, XXXX, filed a title insurance claim with XXXX XXXX/XXXX ; they did recognize the title chain error but deny the title insurance claim unless we default on our loan, even though the policy insures the XX/XX/XXXX loans Deed of Trust to be a valid 1sts position lien, which it is not according to Arizona date of filing law. We filed a claim with the XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX. They said we have a very good case for a civil lawsuit. We consulted four different attorneys and hired XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. of XXXX XXXX XXXX to represent us in negotiation efforts. Mr. XXXX fought for us and our case for two years, but with no success. 

We are a very hard-working middle-class couple quickly approaching our retirement years ; ages now XXXX and XXXX. Our hands are tied and our future uncertain because of the error made in title by the experts at our XXXX refinance that was closed through XXXX XXXX. Through no fault of our own, we are now unable to refinance our home for a substantially lower interest rate which would have allowed us the funds needed to pay down the loans. Those windows of opportunity have now closed. XXXX XXXX error has placed our mortgage in jeopardy, and no one will touch our loan because of the unclear title. 

We have ALL documentation proving XXXX XXXX and WAMUs mistakes. We have all closing documents of the XXXX XXXX refinance. We have copies of correspondence, emails, phone conversations, claims, and their responses. We can, and will, provide anything needed to help resolve this issue. 

We realize this is lengthy, containing many documents and a great deal of information. But we implore you to please read every word in order to fully understand the chain of events that led to this calamity. It is vitally important in our efforts to save our home.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a Loss Mitigation - Loan Modification due to loss of employment and decreased income. I was approved for the Loan Modification request on XXXX XXXX. I was approved for a lower loan payment of {$980.00} ; a decrease from the original payment amount of {$1200.00}. I then completed my trial payments for the following months : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from LoanCare Loss Mitigation Department, asking me to email them a copy of my Trust documents. I sent the copy of my Trust documents to LoanCare via email on XX/XX/XXXX, as requested. 

This is where everything goes downhill. I then received a notification from LoanCare on XX/XX/XXXX, stating my Loan Modification request was denied as they said I failed to provide requested documents. I became very frustrated and worried as I did submit all requested documents in a timely manner. 

I called LoanCare and escalated my concerns to a manager. I spoke with XXXX XXXX and emailed her ( Cc 'd Loss Mitigation Department ), another copy of the Trust document, on XX/XX/XXXX, and then again for a 3rd time on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX then submitted my appeal from the denial and advised me that it would take 30 days for an answer. 

During the 30-day waiting period, I was in constant contact with LoanCare via email and telephone. I contacted LoanCare several days, every week, until the 30 days passed. I then received a call from XXXX XXXX with LoanCare on XX/XX/XXXX, stating my appeal was approved and that I would need to wait another 30 days to see where they would go from there. 

During this waiting period, I was in constant contact with LoanCare via email and telephone. I contacted LoanCare several days, every week, until the 30 days passed. However, I never received any updates as to why my request was taking so long. Every time I called, over the last few months, I have been told something different. If further examples or information is needed, I am happy to provide. 

I ultimately received my final loan documents for the Loan Modification request on XX/XX/XXXX. I completed, signed, notarized, and sent the document back overnight on XX/XX/XXXX. LoanCare received the documents on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX and batched it into their system on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, late in the day. 

I called and spoke with several representatives the Monday morning of XX/XX/XXXX. One of the representatives was rude to me and advised that it will take 1 to 3 months to finalize the Loan Modification request. This frustrated and worried me, as this has gone on way too long. I requested a supervisor and reported my concerns. 

I am now filing an official complaint as I feel this is not right. I have been getting strung along for almost a year, and my lawyer advised me a Loan Modification does not take a year to complete. I feel I have been treated unfairly, and I was penalized for a mistake LoanCare made. They delayed my request further, even though it was their error in not documenting their receipt, of the initial copy of the Trust document, I sent back in XX/XX/XXXX. I have a confirmed sent receipt and was able to prove I sent the documents to them. Yet, even with the appeal approval and multiple escalation requests for rush, my request was never expedited nor completed in a timely manner. 

I am now kindly requesting an Agency Escalation, that my signed loan modification documents be recorded to the County Recorders Office and be fully resolved and completed as soon as possible ; no later than XX/XX/XXXX.

Oh ... so they fixed that, the next day of their awful website all of a sudden it showed payments for XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX. At that time I asked for them to send a payment history to me. They said no problem. About 1 week later I get an application for a modification with them. Mind you I talked with them 2 other times in between this first original phone call. They are VERY RUDE customer service people that will not listen to anything you say. Last night I got the worst representative. She yelled at me several times, interrupted me several times. Told me they did nothing wrong. I asked to speak to a manager 4 times & she refused to get one on the phone. She said they would n't say anything different that she did n't say. My girlfriend & I have gotten all my bank statements for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX. Looks like I 've been paying, I believe they have been applying it to the wrong year and/or month.

I paid for the trial period of 3 months & they applied those payments, I believe to the wrong months, making it look like I did n't make any payments. They refuse to discuss anything, that they may be in the wrong or rectify the situation. Along with refusing to allow me to talk to a manager. They do not have email to write to, they did give me a number for complaints.

623,2020-11-02 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"My complaint is against Fifth Third Mortgage ( 5/3 ). I readily admit and accept responsibility that it was my error in overlooking the {$10.00} increase in my monthly mortgage payment effective XX/XX/XXXX. The generic robo calls and financial hardship information I received I thought was just 5/3 advertising options in case I was having financial hardship, given the uncertainty of the pandemic. I assumed all 5/3 customers were receiving the same since these correspondence were not specifically addressed to me or identifying me or my mortgage. Looking back, I fear 5/3 may have been starting the process of foreclosure, rather than contacting me directly about the ( consistent ) discrepancy in my monthly payments. I know 5/3 is capable of notifying me of insufficient and misappropriated payments because I received at least one mailed letter when they took over my mortgage from my previous mortgage company. In this incident, 5/3 had told me they offered biweekly mortgage payments and even sent literature informing me of how seamless the transition from my previous mortgage company to theirs would be and how nothing in the servicing would change. But it did when 5/3 would not process my biweekly payments and their 'system ' ( per their representative ) didn't know what to do with any payment amount that was not the identical amount to my monthly mortgage payment. ( Please see also my complaints filed XX/XX/XXXX with the Consumer Financial Protection Agency # XXXX and on the same date, with the Federal Trade Commission, reference # XXXX referencing this incident, among others. ) I can not express the continued stress, frustration, lack of trust and confidence I have in 5/3 and their ability to effectively manage my mortgage including applying payments appropriately and notifying me of any payment shortages. I have lost productivity at work, money, and personal leisure time due to repeatedly having to speak with multiple 5/3 individuals at various levels and formulate these multiple written complaints. I have multiple escalated cases with 5/3 and again, have another open case with their Office of the President. I have requested 5/3 transfer my mortgage to another mortgage company who can effectively manage my mortgage and honors biweekly payments ( without me having to call or specifically designate how I want these payments applied to my mortgage ). 5/3 said they would not transfer my mortgage elsewhere, and to leave them, I would have to refinance with another company which would obviously cost me more money and more of my time. I am not a mortgage expert. I rely on my mortgage company to be experts in mortgage management and expect and trust they will apply my payments appropriately and notify me of any problems and concerns. 5/3 has my home address, phone number ( that has active voicemail ), and email to contact me. They failed to inform me of my error in sending monthly mortgage payments {$10.00} less than I should be until 8 months later. At that point, they sent me a letter assessing me a late fee ( which they later removed at my repeated urging ) stating they didn't receive my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment when they actually did. But suddenly after 8 months of accepting the shortage, they would no longer accept it. I am set to receive my escrow reconciliation any day now. I can't wait to see the extent of how overdrawn my escrow is because they were paying my monthly shortage from my escrow. 

I sent 5/3 a copy of the attached letter via certified mail which they received and sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they would investigate my complaint within 25 days. For my original complaint, they took 55 days to investigate and address it but because they failed to address it, I now have complaints about their handling of my compliant ; they just keep multiplying. 

I am not taking any chances this time, hence forwarding my complaint to the CFPB. Again, it was my error and oversight in not sending the {$10.00} increase in my monthly mortgage payment. But there is no acceptable excuse as to why 5/3 did not immediately personally notify me, and rather, use generic computer generated calls/voicemail and printed hardship/potential foreclosure information instead.

I finally was able to get the company to contact an appraiser to begin the process to see if the property was eligible for PMI removal based on current balance and newly appraised value. After receiving notification that the appraisal was completed, I was provided insufficient details on the results beyond "" did not qualify for PMI removal ''. When first requesting detailed support from the appraisal, I was told that the house appraised at a value equal to the exact low end of the appraisal ( not having access to the detailed appraisal yet, my disagreement at the time was voice and I was told to simply file a disagreement. Once being told that, I stated that I would need a copy of the detailed version in order to make a more specific case for my dispute. The representative said she would send the appraisal to my email on file which I had her confirm ( XXXX ). After receiving nothing for a week, I followed up to once again request the detailed appraisal. Finally after requesting detailed documentation for a third time, I finally was providing the detailed appraisal ( as opposed to the summary one page document with no detail ). I find out that the appraisal actually came in ~ {$35000.00} higher than I was originally told the first time. Realizing this may have been an error in initially rejecting my request, I called back today and was put on hold for awhile while another representative looked into why it was denied. Prior to this, I was told that the appraisal needs to be below 80 % XXXX to remove PMI. Similarly, the Mr Cooper website says in plain English that you can request to cancel PMI at a level below 80 % XXXX. Yet, the representative today told me that the current XXXX of 77 % doesn't meet their requirement of 75 % XXXX which is a special requirement since the new value was from an appraisal. He also let me know that there is nothing he can do and nothing I can do except file a detailed dispute. I am in the process of filing the dispute as the initial appraisal ignored an identical comparable that is next door that indicates a value closer to XXXX % XXXX and contained inaccuracies.

As a result I sought relief from my mortgage servicer, Specialized Loan Servicing.  Initially I was denied outright any relief in XX/XX/2020. As conditions worsened, I was able to get a forbearance for 3 months while seeking a modification. I went back and forth for weeks that turned into months, giving them tax documents, letters, P & L statements, bank statements, every single document they asked for. I received letters in the mail every day requesting the same documents over and over again, claiming documents were not signed, documents were not dated, claiming tax returns were not signed or did not contain the PIN number - these are items that are impossible. A tax return can not be filed without a signature or PIN. Why are these documents sufficient for the IRS but not my loan servicer? It was absurd. I would print documents directly from my XXXX program giving Profit & Loss information from requested time frames, only to have SLS claim that the dates were missing. I can not possibly run a report in XXXX without putting in a date range. then SLS would claim there was no company mentioned, or my signature was missing, or a date was missing. They did not care at all about the actual information that was in the documents - income, expenses, etc. It was absurd. One of the last things they claimed was missing was my Hardship Letter, and then claimed it did not even mention COVID. I would have nothing to write about if it didn't mention COVID. Then suddenly the Hardship Letter was found and it was sufficient. In the documents they sent me detailing those documents they received that were valid and those that were invalid, they actually had documents that were listed under both valid and invalid. All I ever requested was to delay the mortgage payment for as many months as I could and modify the loan so that when my payments resume, they are the same, and the mortgage is just pushed out for the number of forbearance months. Ultimately I have been in forbearance for 7 months. Now with 1 month to go, they have denied a modification and are telling me either I owe all of my back payments which total more than {$7000.00}, or I must foreclose or short sell. I want to do none of those. I have no idea why I was denied a modification. I have not asked for a smaller payment than my previous payment. I never have. Every time I have spoken with someone I have been met with belligerent reps. I would like to resume my payments in XXXX at the same amount or about the same amount - I can not afford a jump in payment. And I would like to have my loan modified to extend 7 months longer. I don't know why this is such an unacceptable modification. Because I can not get a straight answer and reasonable modification from them, I am seeking your help.

659,2020-06-24 00:00:00.000000,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"XXXX XXXX, CFO of XXXX XXXX XXXX utilizes unethical acts of lending practices to intimidate and take advantage of the consumer. I worked with his daughter XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to secure my home loan and she was aware I was interested in refinancing soon. I have an email from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX when I inquired about if there were any prepayment penalties and he responded "" no pre pays ever '' so I proceeded forward with using their company. 

I was never informed either verbally or by written disclosure I would not be allowed to refinance within 6 months, otherwise I would have reconsidered accepting this loan or moving forward with this company. Multiple attempts were made to XXXX requesting for assistance with refinancing, which she agreed to assist with but failed to do so. As a result I was forced to seek an alternate mortgage corporation for refinance assistance. When XXXX XXXX received notice from my new lender for the refinance payoff, XXXX began what I truly feel personally as threatening me on multiple occasions by phone and email if I did not agree to their terms and used intimidation as his tactic due to my lack of knowledge as a first time home buyer that I would be liable for the prepayment penalties. 

XXXX tried coercing me to either extend my refinance loan closing date or refinance through his lending company if I did not want to deal with the repercussions. The Truth in Lending Act requires a disclosure form to borrowers that includes a box the lender much check if a prepayment penalty is charged. I did not have this prepayment penalty on my disclosure but he abused this power saying that I would be charged unless I complied. He then retracted this statement after I did my research to confirm I did not have prepayment penalties and relayed my research to him. XXXX then confirmed I was not obligated for prepayment penalties but yet changed his tactic by now threatening that he would file a lawsuit for business loss damages because I was causing intentional harm and that he had already retained counsel. He threatened to hold me accountable for {$14000.00} XXXX XXXX  had to pay my lender XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had every intention of working with him to delay the closing and see other alternatives to help him but his threats and mannerisms in achieving that were so intimidating, unethical and unprofessional to the point that I do not feel safe nor comfortable having him handle my refinance. He utilizes intimidation to obtain his desired result and he had multiple occasions to notify me not to refinance within 6 months but didn't and then tries to intimidate by saying he had a witness ( the notary to his conversation ). I also have my own witness at that conversation and if he had disclosed that, I would not have proceeded forward in XXXX, especially after I had confirmation with him by email on XX/XX/XXXX that I did not nor did his daughter notify me during our email exchange in XX/XX/XXXX. 

According to my closing disclosure, I am under no obligation to pay any monetary prepayment penalties. I fail to understand how XXXX believes it is ethical to harass me to accept his terms with threats and hold me responsible for XXXX XXXX early payoff penalty fees, business loss damages, or any other reason. His attorney sent me an email on XX/XX/XXXX that the letter represented claims to be pursued against me in the event I do not cooperate to avoid damages to XXXX XXXX. and that if we reach a resolution which avoids damages to XXXX XXXX XXXX, there will be no cause to litigate. The basis of their claims are : 1 ) Tortious Interference with Contract - "" You were made aware of these duties at the time you obtained the loan, and you have been made aware of the specific damages which your conduct will cause XXXX XXXX.

2 ) Implied In Fact Contract - Most contracts do not have to be in writing. XXXX XXXX  will seek recovery of the earned fee paid by XXXX XXXX  from you directly. You, by your anticipated conduct, are knowingly waiving the payment by a third party. 
3 ) Quantum Meruit - Even if you had not acknowledged the cost of the services by XXXX XXXX XXXX, the legal doctrine of quantum merit allows for recovery of a reasonable sum of money for services rendered or work done when the amount due is not stipulated in a legally enforceable contract. You are now causing the third party payment to be revoked. XXXX XXXX XXXX will therefore seek direct payment. 
4 ) Unjust Enrichment - You acknowledged that you received a lender credit of {$6100.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX, the lender. That credit was directly for you and did not provide a benefit or payment to XXXX XXXX. Under the doctrine, a person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other. 


I have the following supporting documentation : 1 ) Email from XXXX XXXX confirming there were "" no prepays ever '' when I inquired. He never mentions that I should not refinance within 6 months. 
2 ) Email trail I initiated from XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX requesting refinancing options. This email trail indicates I had every intention to refinance with them. She promised to notify me when the interest rates dropped, yet failed to do so. At that time she had the opportunity to disclose there was an early payoff penalty but chose not to and also does not mention I should not refinance within the 6 months. 
3 ) Late email at XXXX XXXX  from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX threatening to file a lawsuit to pursue all legal remedies to the fullest extent of law and giving a deadline by XXXX  the following day, giving an unfair turnaround of just over 12 hrs. 
4 ) Voicemail transcript on XX/XX/XXXX still threatening a lawsuit even after my response to his email from XX/XX/XXXX to not threaten me going forward and I responded I would be open to a discussion if it was handled in a professional manner. His voicemail untruthfully claimed he had verbal witnesses to testify he disclosed to me but yet he did confirm on XX/XX/XXXX my loan did not have a penalty. He contradicted himself on the grounds for the lawsuit with this statement and yet still threatened a lawsuit if I did not agree. 
5 ) Email letter from his attorney on XX/XX/XXXX that they will proceed forward on this claim if I proceed forward with the closing. 


Note : I have witnesses to the intimidating and threatening phone conversations with XXXX raising his voice to intimidate me that are not included as written support but the summary of the conversation transcript is the same as mentioned above.

I also have had the same mortgage for almost 20 years so it had been awhile since I entered into this process. 

I should have known better because the first thing the account manager asked for was my Debit card number. I gave it to him. They would have to charge me to pull my credit report. I thought this was a little odd but he was also very very very positive and cheery and deceptive and plus, I will be saving so much money with my new loan, what's {$20.00}? I trusted him. Again, stupid. They charged my card for the report. The process was long and arduous as you probably know. I sent them my documents, tax statements, everything short of the dogs, and the account manager continued to be very positive. I was going to get my loan! They next thing I knew, my card had been charged for the appraisal. A whopping {$490.00}. I asked the account manager why they were doing the appraisal so early in the process? First of all, it's a no brainer my home was worth quite a bit per where I live in CA and any of the home value sites showed the value. My home value was a given therefore it didn't ' seem to me we should be doing the appraisal this until the end -- until I knew for sure I was going to get the loan. Oh, cried the account manager, but YOU ARE GOING TO GET THE LOAN!!! 99 % SURE! CAN WE CHARGE YOUR CARD? I believed him and said yes. Well, they made the loan offer but FORGOT I had a second on my mortgage. They FORGOT. I had to tell them over and over. I did so much due diligence FOR THEM. They then said they would need to rethink the offer ( you think? ). Then they turned me down after a couple more weeks and not only charged me for the credit report, the appraisal, but had a {$20.00} fee tacked on to my mortgage I did not know about I just paid. I have now paid out {$530.00} for NOTHING. It's now been a month since they said they would "" at the least '' refund my appraisal fee of {$490.00}.
