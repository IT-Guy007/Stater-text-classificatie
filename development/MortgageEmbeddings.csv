1,"Dear XXXX, During Historical event of XXXX XXXX XXXX, we applied to the Forbearance payment plan with WFHM we were approved. 

After their plan end we apply for a loan modification and we were approved. 

After we send all the documents to XXXX there canceled the Loan Modificacin said that it was not signed correct. ( We did in front of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). 
The XXXX have been in the same offices for XXXX XXXX 

We reapply to a Loan Modification and we received a proposal to do a Short Sale. 

This is the only House we have and we live with our XXXXXXXX XXXX 

WFHM Asking as to pay the full amount at one ( LUMP-SUP PAYMENT ).

Again WFHM is trying to do ilegal activities.

This info is from CFPB home page. 

Forbearance ends with a payment plan, not a lump-sum payment Homeowners who receive XXXX  hardship forbearance are not required to repay their paused payments in a lump sum once the forbearance period ends. You can talk with your mortgage servicer, or start with a XXXX XXXX XXXX agency , to discuss a repayment plan that works for your situation."
2,"The problem began approx. XX/XX/2022. I had a business loan for {$430000.00} with SPS. My monthly payments were $ XXXX. I had a XXXX % interest rate. For some reason, Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ) put money into my checking account ( around {$2800.00} ) that they were not supposed to put in there. I thought it was an escrow overage so I put the money into the stock market and unfortunately, I lost it. Then SPS contacted me to tell me I was behind in my payments. They told me it was not an escrow overage and that they made a mistake putting the money into my checking account and they wanted it back. In XX/XX/2022, I made a double mortage payment of approximately {$5600.00}. However, because my loan is a business loan, they have a default rate of XXXX %. So instead of using that money to catch up on my mortgage, they didn't apply it towards the loan and they sent the payment back to me because I was at default level, which was about {$7000.00} per month instead of {$2800.00}. Since I made the double payment, I believed I was current. I took a business trip to XXXX and I was gone for a month and I was not receiving any mail at my home in XXXX to inform me that I was in default. When I returned to XXXX I advised SPS of these facts but they did not try to help me. I also explained that during the trip to XXXX, my wife and I both contracted XXXX and it affected my earnings. I asked if they could help due to that situation and take me off the default rate so that I could catch up. They explained that it would take a month for them to decide if they would help. I requested that while we were waiting for the one month period if they could take me off the default rate but SPS said they could not do that. So after I waited a month, they declined to help me. Now my situation is worse because now I owe {$14000.00}. I contacted them in XXXX of XXXX five different times to see if they could help me fix this situation but I could only leave messages and no one would call me back. I had to come up with the money which put me in a hardship situation to get out of the default rate. At one point, SPS said they would possibly assist me with getting out of the default rate but they did nothing despite my circumstances. I spoke to a representative at SPS about the double payment and was told that the they should have never mailed that money back to me but should have applied it to the loan. Since I've had a loan with this company, they have taken out double payme nts three times without my permission. If there is something you can do to assist me with this predatory compa ny, I would appreciate it. 

Thank you.

3,"THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE!!!!!!! My complaint submitted XX/XX/23 COMPLAINT ID XXXX has STILL not been resolved. I have been asking for a single point of contact for literal years and have yet to be assigned one. Please give me the name and contact information of my single point of contact! Both Colorado ( CRS 38-38-103.1. Single point of contact ) and federal code ( Civil Code 2923.7 ) mandate that servicers promptly assign a XXXX to the borrowers seeking mortgage modification assistance. Carrington Mortgage LLC has been the servicer on my mortgage for three years, I have submitted countless hardship packets and have been stonewalled and received no response and misinformation from the assorted people that answer the phone in the call center. Please hold this company accountable and make sure that they have met their obligation to assign a single point of contact BEFORE closing the complaint."
4,"At the end of XXXX I turned XXXX years old. My husband has passed away. My husband was a veteran and that is how I have a VA loan. I needed to stay home and isolate during the pandemic out of fear of infection. After the forbearance I requested a VA partial claim on XX/XX/XXXX. The partial claim was sent out XX/XX/XXXX. My memory is not great and I misplaced the documents and did not return them in time. My understanding that since the partial claim did not go through is that I am eligible for another one. I requested an updated partial claim. My interest rate is 3.25 % and a partial claim would have allowed me to keep that rate. My lender refused to send my loan to VA for another partial claim. Then in XXXX, XXXX they ran my loan for a modification and sent me an application. I did not fill the application out correctly and it was denied. I was verbally told the VA was unwilling to help me. I asked for the VA denial in writing and was told they would not provide. My lender is now calling XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. They refuse to take my husband 's name off the calls ( even though they have the death certificate ) and they call and ask for my deceased husband. This is very hard on me as his death was very difficult for me. I ask them not to leave voice messages for my deceased husband as it causes stress, they told me no. I feel as though I am in a bad position because my lender did not send me to VA for the partial claim while it was available. Also, they have sent me to an attorney for foreclosure action. How can they foreclose and kick me out when they blocked assistance that would have brought my loan current?"
5,"On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I feel behind on my loan payments and started a accommodation repayment plan to take care of the past due payments due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. This payment arrangement was set up with Flagstar bank who then and currently services my mortgage. Upon completion of these payments arrangement I was informed that my loan would be brought back current and there would be no derogatory remarks on my credit report. My account has been brought back current but the derogatory remarks and late payments still remain. 

This is a clear violation of the "" CARES ACT '' that was passed by congress on XXXX XXXX, which was retroactive from XX/XX/XXXX to the end of the global pandemic. 

I have attached a copy both payment modifications and credit reporting of late payments"
6,"I went on COVID relief plan, and have been trying to get off the plan for over 1 year. Every time I send them all the paperwork they request and I call for a decision they kept on asking for the same paperwork over and over again. They requested that I don't make payments and then they say the application has expired... Went through this process multiple times.. Now they say I need to send them nearly {$200000.00}. Which of course I don't have. There is way so much more to this story PLEASE help me."
7,"My father passed away and my name is now on the Deed of the property. We have provided this information already to the mortgage company. The loan was previously being serviced by XXXX but in the spring of XXXX, it was transferred to Rightpath Servicing. Prior to the transfer, we were offered COVID relief to defer payments for 1 year. We were then advised by XXXX to make trial payments until the modification was final which we did. Once the account was transferred to XXXX, the modification was cancelled due to us not returning the modification documents. We made several calls to XXXX to let them know that we never received the modification documents and were advise that they would resend them. That never happened and we were advised that we would have to try for another modification. We sent the requested documents such as my paystub, an application for assistance, my social security number, and my employment contract. I was advised that my application was complete on XX/XX/XXXX and no further documents were needed. On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, we were advised that the modification was denied because the previous trial payments were not made. The trial payments ended when we were advised that the previous modification was cancelled, and we would have to start the application again. Furthermore, we have been attempting to contact our single point of contact who is never available when we call in. We have requested callbacks but do not get a callback. I was told on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX that the squeaky wheel gets the grease so I would have to call daily in an attempt to reach my single point of contact. The account is now in Foreclosure status which started right before the latest loan modification application was in the underwriting process. Rightpath servicing is no longer accepting payments and are making it impossible to speak to our single point of contact and have been advised that only the single point of contact can let me know what my options are now."
8,"United Wholesale Mortgage and XXXX XXXX XXXX refinanced our mortgage in XXXX of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I went online to pay my mortgage as I have done every month since the refinance. I noticed that my account stated that I must pay {$10000.00} by XX/XX/XXXX or else my mortgage payment would double for the next XXXX  months. 

After contacting UWM I found that my escrow account had been in arrears and this was the reason for the need to pay {$10000.00}, none of which would go toward my principle. It happened that we had received an insurance payout from the loss of my mother no more than XXXX days prior or I would not have been able to make any payment. I was not able to pay the entire amount so I paid {$5000.00} and said that I would most likely be able to pay the rest by XXXX. At that time I was told that even after paying the XXXX, my monthly mortgage payment was increasing from {$1300.00} per month to a whopping {$1800.00} for the next XXXX  months and that a reassessment would be done in XXXX of XXXX. After making this payment my account on the website was showing that my next monthly payment was not due until XXXX of XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called UWM again to pay the remaining {$5000.00}. At that time I was told that I actually owed {$5700.00}, and that I would need to make a payment of {$1800.00} in booth XXXX and XXXX, and every month thereafter. 

While my property taxes did go up, they only went up by {$2000.00}. Bottom line is that the title company grossly underestimated my escrow payment, without the tax increase. And the bigger problem is that UWM never notified me at any time until my phone call on XX/XX/XXXX that my escrow account was low or empty. I was told that I had opted for digital communication and that was the reason. Last time I checked email was digital communication. I have received at least XXXX emails from them since, but none since XX/XX/XXXX when I set up my online account and received a confirmation email. 

This error is unconscionable and would cause a majority of homeowners into foreclosure. There needs to be some repercussion for the title company 's careless calculation of escrow and UWM 's negligence through failure to notify me of the escrow deficit."
9,"We had a mortgage with Wells Fargo beginning in XXXX. In XXXX my husband had XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX leading to a long hospital stay then XXXX  months of home confinement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX When the battle with the XXXX had finally been won the XXXX  XXXX specialist cleared him to begin XXXX XXXX  and a home program and was finally cleared to go back to work after another XXXX months. 

One year had passed with no work or paychecks and with 2 college tuitions it became very difficult to stay on top of our monthly expenses.

Then the real estate market crashed with my husband a XXXX  and me a XXXX  he was forced to file for unemployment until that expired in XX/XX/XXXX. 

In order not to default on our mortgage we were forced to wipe out our entire savings account, cash in both our XXXX XXXX  's and even sold some of my jewelry to stay afloat. 

We contacted Wells Fargo on many occasions with of course no resolution. We were advised to meet us with XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX to work through a loan modification. I have a binder full of documents that were submitted over and over again to Wells Fargo and what did they come back with for a solution? # 1 We were spending too much money on groceries and # 2 give us a 6 month moratorium on payments but at the end was a balloon payment for the full amount! They just had us go through the motions with NO intention of modifying the loan.

During this time we had to put our house on the market ( remember it was during the real estate crash! ) and ended up selling it like a fire sale and losing over {$75000.00}.

Had we received the modification we could still be in our house that we built back in XXXX with no mortgage instead we had to sell the house at a loss and at XXXX XXXX XXXX we will NEVER recover from this. Although President Obama had pushed these mortgage companies to do right by their clients they never had any intention of providing any relief. 

I had submitted a claim to you but you "" closed '' the complaint when Wells Fargo said they only hold records for 7 years and couldn't "" find '' our account. Serioiusly??? That was a sufficient reason to close the file? They are one of the worst companies for so many ways they have screwed their customers and should not be allowed to continue their illegal tactics. How is it they only keep records for 7 years? How does that work in fixing their past mistakes without any records? 

For their convenience here is my mortgage number they "" couldn't find '' XXXX. 

BTW the XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX admitted they only had ONE modification out of the hundreds that applied."
10,"Regions Bank filed a lien on my property at XXXX XXXX XXXX Tennessee XXXX on XX/XX/2007. I recently contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX at phone # XXXX, ( XXXX ). I have contacted several regions associates and every XXXX keep passing me to someone else ( from XXXX branch to another branch ) but getting no results. The address to Regions Bank that has filed the lien on my property is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Alabama XXXX. I find this debt to be invalid and possibly fraudulent. Thank you for investigating this matter."
11,"My mortgage co. claimed i have missed payment without providing any proof or documents to me. I have not missed any payments i have bank statements to prove them wrong, but the mortgage co. will not listen or provide proof. instead they put my mortgage in a loan modification with a higher interest. 

Shellpoint mortgage"
12,"This Company i, e, Wellsfargo Charged Me {$400000.00} To Bring My Account Current in The Past & They Charge Me Money Every Year For Having Escrow Low Due To Their Calculations! I Feel It was Illegal to Charge Me {$400000.00} Without Me being Able To Bring My Account Current In The Past! I want To Know If I Am Due Monies For Past & Present Charges! Due To The current Settlement!"
13,I have tried three separate times to work with the loss mitigation team with Carrington Mortgage group and applied for forbearance in which the company denied all request for loan modification even when I had agreed to a loan modification in three separate payments presented to me by the company. Now the company refuses to look over my application for loan modification once again and has placed my home in foreclosure and has not made it easy for me to get any answers with the foreclosure time frame to stop the foreclosure process and work out a deal with me.
14,"I get XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX Wednesday of the month and my mortgage with midland mortgage, is due by the XXXX of every month. Every month I get charged a late fee ( $ XXXX {$9.00} ) I have tried to change my due date to no avail. I call every month to get my late fee credited, to my knowledge, I was under the impression that the requested fee was credited every month til XX/XX/22 I was informed that I am only allowed 1 credit a year. So the other 11 calls for the late fee credit did not actually happen. The fee may be minor but it adds interest to my overall balance of my mortgage. 
I was told that I would have to sign an agreement for midland mortgage to electronically withdraw my payment. I declined due to past increases that I was unaware of."
15,"I've now missed two closing dates XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX due to no negligence on my part. The underwriter is refusing to approve my loan in spite of being qualified. Each time the closing date is near, the underwriter adds items to be provided. I've had to supply unreasonable documents that have nothing to do with being able to afford the home. I'm a XXXX woman, on the loan alone and I believe a XXXX  woman making my income, close to XXXX, would not be discriminated against the way I am. I've constantly been told "" this is the last item needed '', yet right before closing, more things are added. Making it impossible to make closing deadline. They can't lawfully deny me because I qualify, so I'm being discriminated against in hopes I don't comply, so the loan can then be denied. This is unacceptable and I will fight all the way to the Supreme Court if needed to fight this."
16,"PHH decided, without asking me or receiving a request from me, to take over my homeowner insurance policy payment. I had a valid policy for homeowner 's insurance through XXXX XXXX, and PHH decided that PHH would to pay it. That is a problem for me, because PHH will charge me more money than XXXX XXXX did if I paid it on my own. Now, the insurance company says that they can't talk to me, that I have to talk to the mortgage company. The mortgage company says that I need to call my XXXX XXXXXXXX Trustee, who has nothing to do with the issue of the mortgage company taking over my homeowner 's insurance policy without my request, and without talking to me."
17,"I called in to pay my mortgage on XX/XX/2022 to ensure my account did not fall 30 days past due. I spoke to a representative over the phone who assisted me with processing the payment and provided me with a confirmation number. I received a notice that my mortgage was 30 days deliquent and the company informed me they had no recollection of my call. According to their records there were no notes on the account. I pulled up my call log and I called in at XXXX  that morning and spoke with someone who processed the payment for me. I asked the employee to pull the call. The managers shared with me they do not record all of their calls and could not locate the call. I have a 100 % on time payment history prior to this, and I take pride in that. I should not be penalized because their representative and their system did not document the interaction accordingly and factually. I have researched the company, New Rez and apparently this happens often. I am requested my payment history be reported accurately and timely, as my bill was paid within my 30 day window."
18,"XXXX SUBMITTED ON XX/XX/XXXX PRODUCT Mortgage ISSUE Trouble during payment process Wells Fargo Executive Office responded XX/XX/XXXX that {$16000.00} paid by a Federal Agency to Wells was entered and there was a transfer error not properly corrected before Wells dumped my loan to XXXX  - Wells had over 45 days from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX correct this problem. 

Wells Fargo has failed to carry out the legal process upon receipt of Federal Funds and proper distribution to homeowner account. Wells showed utter contempt for homeowners gaining assistance from a Federal Agency to make this payment and borders on retaliatory conduct. Why was my loan dumped during a federal fund payment process transfer days after loan payment was made to Wells? Why has almost 55 days passed and NO CORRECTIVE action taken by Wells to notify XXXX? Is Wells attempting to keep the Federal Funds and not perform legal due diligence to pay FEDERAL FUNDS into the homeowner account? Question is WHY? Wells should be held accountable. 

Wells response letter dated XX/XX/XXXX - "" stated check sent for XXXX -- Wells can confirm we didn't receive a check in the amount of {$17000.00} '' -Wells also stated information was not sent for a Modification - both statement border on deceptive practices and scams! Worked closely with Home Preservation XXXX @ XXXX that received all my documents not once but several times. ( see attachments ) This letter borders on Deceptive Practice and RETALIATION for seeking mortgage assistance. A FEDERAL Homeowner RIGHT! 

Wells has added more deleterious harms to the homeowner. For ex : Wells Fargo added {$3200.00} legal fees for FORECLOSURE ( never filed ) to the loan transfer to XXXX  -- not warranted ( see last statement from Wells XX/XX/XXXX ) NO LEGAL FEES existed. My home was NOT in Foreclosure!! - My complaint is that XXXX is moving fast ( within 30 days ) to foreclose on my home due to Wells Fargo deceptive practices and discriminatory retaliation. Wells Fargo should be held accountable after over 55 days for not transferring FEDERAL FUNDS to XXXX!!"
19,"On XX/XX/23, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) from the "" advocate '' area ( I guess? ) called me and left a voicemail. With no information. No direction. No help. No reason. NOTHING. Just XXXX, Roundpoint mortgage. Call us back. *END* Their phone tree takes far too long. There was no direction, no 'general ' area to talk to someone who can get me to the right place. I have spent 45 minutes on the phone with them and still do not have an actual answer as to why I was called.

Further, the amount of literature/information that was provided regarding whether autopay was or was not set up, who/how/when payments that were set up with the old company are or are not going to be switched over etc. were all confusing as XXXX. Some of the emails I received I have a minor in finance. I was a XXXX in college for a finance class. While I am not the smartest in the area, I am certainly far above average, so if I can not dissect that information, what hope does the average ( or below average ) person have? 

A company that handles dollar amounts the size of mortgages needs to have a level of service that is commensurate. A reasonable amount of time with any customer service representative should at least indicate if it is worth my time to discuss further. To find out that this was a voicemail in regards to a complaint I filed about the transfer process being garbage was a full circle failure by this company."
20,"On XX/XX/XXXX I then called the foreclosure attorney XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, she stated that after our conversation she received confirmation from her client to proceed with the foreclosure and that she made one attempt to alert me of the foreclosure still moving forward but was not able to reach me and there fore my home was auctioned off with out no other publication and after I received confirmation from both XXXX and the attorneys handling the foreclosure.

In addition I am attaching the foreclosure publication documents I received on XX/XX/XXXX showing Wells Fargo as the prior mortgage servicer named as the foreclosing mortgage servicer on record but as I stated and have attached the Serving transfer letter Wells Fargo was no longer involved with my home as of XX/XX/XXXX. I believe my home was illegally foreclosed on and that XXXX and its investors and Trustees did not have the proper authority to foreclose on my home."
21,"During XXXX, I used the CARES Act to apply for XXXX hardship mortgage forebearance. I contacted BBT/Truist in XX/XX/XXXX to let them know that my hardship was over and that I was ready to resume my mortgage payments. I was told that it did not just "" pick back up '' where I left off but instead I either had to pay all my missed payments in one lump sum or I needed to do a loan modification. Since I could not afford to lump payment I told them I would do the Loan Modification. 

I was given the parameters that I needed to follow. Starting XX/XX/XXXX I started making monthly payments again on my mortgage. I followed all rules set forth for me regarding trial payments and was told I had met the requirements for loan modficiation. I filled out all paperwork and had it notarized. It was sent back and received by the company on XX/XX/XXXX. I continued to make my monthly payments while waiting for the loan to be removed from loss mitigation. Each time a payment was made via telephone I would ask about the status of my loan and the representative was never able to give me any details. I was only told to continue to wait. 

In early XXXX I recieved ANOTHER copy of the loan modification paperwork and was told I had to re do it all due to an error on their end. So we filled out the paperwork and had it notarized for a second time. It was received back by Truist Bank on XX/XX/XXXX according to tracking records. 

Since that time I have not been removed from loss mitigation nor has my loan been modified. I have continued to call monthly to make my mortgage payment and each time ask where I am at in the process and I can never get an answer, except to please be patient and continue to wait. 

Since letting Truist Bank know I no longer was under hardship, I have made 14 payments, filled out modification paperwork twice and yet nothing has changed. My payments do not go towards my balance but instead are being held in a suspense account. I continue to receive statements showing my mortage is in loss mitigation and my balance due continues to grow. I have continued to advise the customer representatives that I am no longer under a hardship and ready to continue to a conventional mortgage but nothing has been done."
22,"I took a forbearance option for Covid relief in XXXX XXXX XXXX  with Freedom Mortgage Corporation. During this time I was told XXXX of my options under this program was that I could put the payments missed toward the end of the loan interest free and that it would be discussed that the end of the forbearance term. I had XXXX extensions, XXXX in XXXX, and XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX, both to which I was informed for clarification purposes that my option was to put the payments at the end of my loan term interest free and this option would be enacted at the end of forbearance. It is now that time for this option to be enacted and I am told that option is no longer available under the VA and my only XXXX options is to pay an additional XXXX a month for 6 months it start a new term loan with skyrocketed interest rates under a new term if I qualify. Im not sure how this relief plan helped anyone but I am cheated."
23,"Hi I have several months and several times asking to this bank to remove the private Morgage Insurance because my property has more than 20 % in equity and I sent the recently appraisal of my property to the bank ( about 1 month ago in my online bank account ) I sent several request to get removed the Private morgage insurance that I am paying monthly because I have a conventional credit but bank is not giving me answers, same way in coronavirus time I asked reduce my interest and they skip my request and just the put my debt for coronavirus in my Morgage and never gave me the promotional interest what government was offering although I asked it in that moment, so they never gave me the promotional interest rate and now they are not also giving me any answers!! I am tired of asking answers and they skip it because is not themselves interest, thats unfair!!! I want my interest rate what I asked in that time of 3 % and I want now to remove the PMI!! I need a specific answer to remove the private Morgage insurance because my property is value now in more than $ XXXX and I just had a debt with bank of $ XXXX, a have BIG EQUITIY I dont need to pay anymore the PMI, see attached the appraisal that I sent to the bank about 1 month ago in my loan care account online showing a value of {$400.00}"
24,"I have lived in my house since XX/XX/XXXX purchase {$340000.00}. My princpal loan should be lower by now but my mortgage was a predatory morgage sold to me by Wells Fargo. The initial loan term was 6.75 % 30 years fixed interest only. Because the loan was predatory, we defaulted in the time of recession. When i requested for loan modification on the loan on or about XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo Charged me interest of {$19000.00}, before modifying my loan. While other banks forgave debt. What Wells Fargo did to my family is causing undue fininacial hardship and the bulk of my loan is left to be paid. Although we are far advance on the 30years payment we still have high principal balance {$270000.00}. What Wells Fargo did to us is unfair and predatory. Therefore, we demand that Wells Fargo pay us back {$19000.00} with interest for selling to us predatory mortgage and we request debt forgiveness. Predatory loan mortages is a crime and should be banned from American. 

Thank you"
25,"Five months ago when i made my last complaint i hoped this issue would be resolved finally but it hasn't. My family and i have been going through this nightmare for about 3 years with this company and it is clear that they are only interested in a outcome that benefits them and only them. There is no way the practices can be legal and something must be done about it. They seem only interested in stealing our money and coming up with excuses why they are not going to honor these agreement. First they demanded the same documents repeatedly for almost a year to even start the re-modification process. Then once they were forced they put an agreement on the table and refused to honor it by delaying for months then saying we hadn't made the requisite payment. Then it happened a second time now its happening again. They have collected thousands with the false promise that it would be resolved after but they absolutely refuse to do what is right. When will this borderline criminal behavior be reigned in. Two years in with covid 19 running wild i could it and ended up in the hospital. I didn't know if i was going to make it so i deeded my house to my son to help my son and my family avoid a long costly probate fight. My son agreed to help honor what i thought was my dying wish, I somehow survived. Now they expect me go back to my son and reverse this with absolutely no guarantee this nightmare will end. My son has seen them make agreement after agreement that they did not honor, how is he supposed to believe this company now? XXXX is tied to Carrington and need to force them to honor this agreement."
26,"We heard there may be a law sued by Wells Fargo. In 1981 we worked out a plan with Wells Fargo to pay our mortgage 6 months on time and they would work out a plan to modify our mortgage. We paid over 6 months and they contacted us shortly prior to XXXX 1981 with no modification the same mortgage with all the back payment and interest due at one time. We were back on our feel but could not do that we were fine with paying it back over time on the tail end etc. But had to way to come up with all upfront. We called customer service and they said too bad and would start foreclosure on us. Many friends with other companies were receiving modifications very favorable but we were floored. The address was XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX"
27,"I obtained a mortgage from Movement Mortgage for a new construction purchase in XX/XX/XXXX. This being a new construction, the property taxes were estimated by applying XXXX XXXX tax rate to the purchase price. A common practice, but resulting in over-estimating of the tax obligation. In XXXX of that year, I received a notice form XXXX XXXX of my XXXX tax assessment. I contacted Movement MortgageXXXX, my servicer, advising of the assessment and requesting my monthly escrow payment to be adjusted. I was directed to a website to upload XXXX XXXX communication stating the annual tax amount. I did so the same day. There was no action taken or any communication from the servicer. I followed up again in XXXX where I was told that an escrow analysis needs to be performed and that does not happen until XXXX year after closing ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I advised that I request it to be done now since the tax amount is known and I am overpaying more than {$100.00} every month. That request was sent to the escrow department. Again, my monthly payment was not adjusted. I called again In XXXX. I was told that the servicer had to wait to pay the tax bill, which was now done, to adjust my tax escrow. Another request was sent to the escrow department to for an escrow analysis as the initiation of an adjustment to my monthly payments. XXXX the next 45 days I made at approximately the phone calls to the customer service department following up. Every time, I encountered another representative who was very sympathetic and understanding towards my case promising that they will rectify the situation and ensure me that an escrow refund check will be requested and my payments will be adjusted. When I asked for a phone number to the escalations department or for the case to be escalated. I was told that there is no escalations department and that a supervisor will call me back, this being the only escalation possible. XXXX never called me back. The following call I made ( late XXXX ), resulted in me finding out that no escrow analysis was performed yet, but it was now requested. I received a follow up call advising that my payments for XXXX will be adjusted and that I will receive a refund check for {$1300.00}. XXXX XXXX, I received the statement showing same amount owed for the XXXX payment and still no refund check. I finally was connected to a XXXX XXXX phone calls later, who told me that the escrow analysis on purchases are not done until 18 month after closing. I advised that this is not industry standard and that I provided them with the tax bill. There is a limit of the overage a servicer can hold in an escrow account and that after 18 months this will be excessive. I advised that I need it resolved or I will have no choice than to contact the CFPB as this matter has been ongoing for XXXX months. My case was then escalated to the ( non-existent, per prior conversations ) escalations department. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was advised via phone and email that my payment was adjusted fairly and a refund check was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1700.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed advising no check was received and was asked to wait until tomorrow, and the rep will follow up with me on Monday. On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I advised that there is still no check. I was advised the same day that a stop payment was requested and an ACH transfer to my checking account is being processed. On XX/XX/XXXX, still no ACH transfer, however, a check was received in the mail. I reached out to the representative inquiring, whether a stop payment was put on the check, or if I am OK to deposit since no XXXX deposit was received. The response on XX/XX/XXXX via phone and email advised that the rep confirmed that no stop payment is in place that that I am OK to deposit the check, which will now resolve the escalation and they are closing the case. I deposited the check. Next day, my bank issued a hold on my account and placed a fraud flag. When I called to ask what happened, I was told that I deposited a check with a stop payment and it will be returned. As a last ditch effort to work with my servicer, I reached out XXXX more time to Movement Mortgage on XXXX days ago with no response. My checking account was temporary frozen and I have a fraud alert associated with my name. I have been very patient with my servicer, spending hours actively trying to resolve a standard servicing request for more than XXXX months. I would like CFPB to intervene to resolve this issue before I incur additional damages to my finances and reputation."
28,"My husband and I went into Wells Fargo back in XXXX for a regular fixed rate mortgage ( term 30 years ). We began making payments. The mortgage loan was for {$80000.00} ( XXXX XXXX dollars ). Fifteen years later -- -we still owe more than {$52000.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars ). Our payments were not fixed. The payments ranged from {$420.00} to over {$1000.00} a month. We are both XXXX since XXXX XXXX XXXX. We wrote to Wells Fargo and they sent us back tons of paper saying that we agreed to some kind of equity loan. That's not true. We simply asked for a fixed rate mortgage. Each time that we went into the bank, we said we were paying on our mortgage, after some time, the teller would find our account and have a strange look on their face for a brief moment. I always wondered what was on the screen the teller looked at.So far, they've gotten about {$240000.00} from us. We still owe {$52000.00}. As a minority, we believe we were taken advantage of. We believe we are victims of predatory lending by Wells Fargo. Can you help us? It's XXXX and will still owe {$53000.00} and have made all of the payments ( even during the pandemic )."
29,Fees and other charges not initially disclosed but shows on the statement after loan was processed.
30,"On XXXX, XXXX XXXX my husband did a loan modification on our 30yr fixed mortgage with Wells Fargo XXXX Per the terms of the loan modification, we were to pay {$870.00} at a yearly interest rate of 3 % on the new balance on {$140000.00} under the Note and Security Instrument. Like most Americans during this time, a reduction in mortgage was a relief due to our reduced income from layoffs. We paid this balance for 11 years until we refinanced in XXXX for a better interest rate with a new lender. This is when we became aware that our mortgage with Wells Fargo was changed to a 40+ mortgage, with us still needing to pay 40 more years. After learning that we were also victims of Wells Fargo mortgage fraud, I called all the lawyers and agencies associated with suing Wells Fargo. However, I was told that I was too late to get in on any of the lawsuits. I have just become aware of the latest CFPB action taken against Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, and was told they did not have us listed for any kind of compensation due to XXXX mortgage fraud. I hope someone within your bureau will be able to assist us with this issue."

32,"We currently have a mortgage with Cardinal Financial Company , Limited Partnership. We purchased our home XX/XX/XXXX. Our initial mortgage payment was {$2300.00}. We filed our homestead for the property taxes in XX/XX/XXXX which was {$2100.00}. The company analyzed our escrow account in XX/XX/XXXX stating it was short due to the property taxes going to be {$2900.00}. The amount was {$2900.00} but when we filed homestead it came down to the {$2100.00}. We forwarded the necessary paperwork to the company showing that the payment was {$2100.00}. They confirmed that they received it ; however they stated that the paperwork wasn't sufficient enough. They took our mortgage payment up to {$2400.00} and we started that payment in XX/XX/XXXX. We continued to make our payments. In XX/XX/XXXX they paid the {$2100.00} for our property taxes instead of the {$2900.00}. But in XX/XX/XXXX they analyzed the escrow again by anticipating that the property taxes would be {$2900.00} for the XXXX year. We contacted them on today XXXX XXXX and was told we have to submit the homestead paperwork every year. In the State of MS , you only have to file homestead once. They are over charging our escrow account and owe us a refund."
33,"Wells Fargo foreclosed and stold my home while not helping to remodify our loan payments, my husband XXXX XXXX over this in XX/XX/2013. They harassed me daily and attached late payments when full payments couldn't be made. We had a hardship with the loss of my income leaving only his and we struggled with them, fighting with them for well over a year. They took my home not understanding that I had lost my husband and I had gotten sick and wasn't working. Along with taking my home they took my father 's inheritance and my ira totalling XXXX dollars that we put into a down payment when making the initial loan. We paid Wells Fargo for that home for over 17 yr period and the loan was only for XXXX. They hurt us badly."

Re: Loan #
To whom it may concern:
My name is XXXX XXXX and I became a customer of 5th 3rd bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX, when my 
mortgage loan was purchased from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. During this process, I was under the 
impression that the deal had been made between my old servicer (XXXX XXXX XXXX) and my new 
servicer (5th 3rd bank) and the only thing I needed to do was start making payments to 5th 3rd bank. To 
date, I have made all of my mortgage payments in full and timely. 
On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received a message from my homeowner's insurance company XXXX) that my 
insurance policy will expire on XXXX if the payment of XXXX  was not received. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XXXX and made changes to my policy and at that time the payment 
amount changed from XXXX to XXXX. I sent the updated EOI (Evidence of Insurance) to 5th 3rd bank 
on XXXX reflecting the amount of XXXX  was the new amount that needed to be paid to Hippo 
Insurance.
I called back 5th 3rd bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX, to inquire if the payment was sent out to Hippo Insurance. 
I was advised that payment for XXXX was sent via regular mail on XXXX XXXX XXXX, and to allow 7-10 
days for the payment to be received and processed. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received a call from XXXX XXXX XXXX  who claimed to be my case manager. During the call I was advised that once XXXX XXXX 
received the payment that was mailed out on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX there would be nothing, they 
would be able to do with that check due to there being a ""stop payment"" placed on that check and 
another payment will be overnighted on XXXX XXXX XXXX At this time, I became very upset due to my 
concern about being charged returned check fee, etc. XXXX apologize and said, ""the overnighted payment 
will beat the payment that was regularly mailed on the XXXX XXXX XXXX"". I had additional questions and 
reached out to XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I never received a call back. 
During this time that I had been getting the run around from all of 5th 3rd banks representatives, the 
weather in my area in XXXX  was very dangerous and extreme (trees falling into homes, etc.). I was 
very nervous and stressed knowing that I was getting the runaround and my homeowner's insurance had 
expired on XXXX. I did the next best thing I knew to do and obtained new home insurance to 
protect my investment and your collateral to my loan. I sent the new EOI (Evidence of Insurance) from 
XXXX for XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I called back 5th 3rd bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX, and spoke with XXXX with ID #: XXXX to ask 
checking on the issuance of the payment. XXXX  advised me that I had to work with XXXX and she would 
send him an email asking him to call me back. I advised XXXX that I would work with him but he does 
not call back. At this point, I asked to speak with XXXX supervisor and she advised me that I could 
not speak with anyone but XXXX. I informed her that XXXX has not returned any of my calls from the 
multiple messages I left him. I asked XXXX if she denying me a manager, as it's a simple yes or no 
question? XXXX advised me that she did not feel comfortable answering with a simple yes or no. In 
spite of this, XXXX just continued the reckless treatment I had received thus far. At this point XXXX 
finally decided to get me over to her supervisor's voicemail. I did leave a voicemail and to date 
(1/30/2023) I am still waiting to hear back from that manager.
On XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX decided to call me back and confirmed the payment that was mailed in 
""Regular"" mail on XXXX XXXX XXXX, had a stop payment on it, the payment that was supposed to have 
been overnighted never was overnighted and there was a payment put back in the ""Regular"" mail on 
XXXX XXXX XXXX. I requested to speak with XXXX supervisor. XXXX transferred me over to his supervisor by 
the name of XXXX at (XXXX). I expressed to XXXX how inefficient 5th 3rd bank representatives 
are and how frustrated I have been because I am continuously getting the runaround. I asked Talley why, 
with the severity of the issue that was going on with the expiring of my homeowner's insurance for nonpayment from my servicer, the payment wasnt wired to the insurance company, as originally promised. 
XXXX advised me that to wire, 5th 3rd representative would have to have the insurance company's wire 
information. I was even more shocked and felt brushed off and made to feel no urgency on the part of 
5th 3rd bank to ensure their collateral and my loan was protected. I advised XXXX that he should have a 
coaching moment for his entire time on how to work efficiently and prioritize the customer in a situation 
like this, as it made sense to use the wire option. 
On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I reached out to the corporate office and spoke with XXXX  with ID # XXXX who 
said she was a supervisor. The only thing XXXX  was able to do is to confirm the payment schedule on the 
dates the payments were supposed to have gone out and the method the payments were supposed to 
have been made. Also, she provided a tracking # XXXX for the payment that went out 
overnight after I spoke with the representative in the Escrow Insurance department of 5th3rd bank. 
I received a call from XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX advising me that my mortgage payment amount will 
increase for XXXX due to a shortage in my escrow account being in the negative. WHY and how is 
this my problem? The shortage in my escrow account is a direct result of your companies incompetence 
and inefficiencies! I made my monthly payments on time every month, per my original loan documents 
that I signed. Those payments included money to cover my taxes and insurance. The duty of your 
company was to take those escrow payments and pay them in a timely manner.
At this point, I am being strong-armed for my money as well as penalized because I am being made to 
pay for the inefficient actions of 5th 3rd bank. While I have reached out to a local Real Estate attorney for 
guidance in this matter, as I believe that your company has violated its fiduciary duty in the servicing of 
my loan, I am not willing to risk my home NOT being covered by insurance. Ultimately, I asked XXXX if he 
could reach out and request an emergency re-analyzation of my escrow account until I can get the 
payment back from XXXX and send it back in and XXXX stated that he was advised that could not 
happen until that payment comes back in. I dont find this acceptable and am writing directly to you, hoping you can remedy my account's egregious treatment.
I look forward to your anticipated prompt response addressing my many concerns about the failed 
treatment of a ""New"" customer of 5th 3rd bank. Feel free to contact me directly.
Regards,"
35,"I previously had complaint number XXXX with you all. After the company provided a response you all closed the complaint. However, the company 's response did not address the issues and our escrow account continues to be handled inappropriately. 

They are not recognizing the fact that I have 3 insurance policies and they are not escrowing sufficient months funds.

Furthermore, despite repeated inquiries, they have failed to disclose how they handled the {$8000.00} I mailed them in XX/XX/2022 to be placed in my escrow account. 

My suspicions now are that dishonest actions have taken place or incompetency is at the root of this issue. 

I would greatly appreciate your opening of a new complaint and KEEPING IT OPEN until the matter is satisfactorily resolved. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX"
36,"This company is absolutely lying. I have several pieces of proof that I have complied. In fact their own agent has confirmed that indeed he was here several months ago and collected my signed document which his company photographs and sends to them.

But I agreed to sign again. Sure enough, he was just at my door again on XXXX XXXX fo the same thing again. He recalled again that he was here. This has been going on yearly. I received four such documents with the threat of foreclosing my home. I intend to file criminal harassment charges against them It is beyond cruel that I must receive these constant threats. I have been advised by my local police department that since I have substantial proof that I have been enduring this yearly and actually have this gentleman showing up at my door fo the same this constitutes harassment. I am still being verbally abused by their callers.

37,"FACTS My mortgage servicer is Citizens. Due to XXXX, I have had higher household/family expenses and have struggled to make my mortgage payments. In XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ohio for assistance. With the help of Legal Aid, I applied for mortgage assistance through Ohio XXXX XXXX XXXX 's Homeowners Assistance Fund ( HAF ) program, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Ohio XXXX XXXX XXXX conditionally approved her application. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX is still waiting for Citizens to complete their part of the process. In accordance with XXXX Treasury guidance, after an application is approved, XXXX XXXX XXXX uses a Secure Data Exchange to send an information record to the servicer. There should be at least one person at Citizens who has access to this secure portal and is responsible for sending back a verification record to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Once XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX has that record, they can process the payment and sent it to Citizens. As of today, Citizens has not sent that verification record back, leaving me in limbo. 

WHAT WE HAVE DONE I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX multiple times to get an update on their communication with the servicer. Most recently, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX emailed Citizens another record request on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contacted Citizens on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they had not received a record request from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. The person I spoke with did not seem to understand that the records must be sent through XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX 's secure data exchange, not through fax. 

This issue can be resolved if Citizens participates in XXXX XXXX XXXX appropriately by utilizing the Secure Data Exchange as suggested by XXXX Treasurer guidance. If they do not know how, they should call XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX."
38,"My mortgage was recently transferred to Freedom Mortgage Company from XXXX, the PMI had been removed last year when my loan dropped below the 78 percent mark. Freedom Mortgage added the PMI back to my loan even through it was at the 75 percent loan to value ratio and refuses to return the money that they erroneously charged me for the past three months. This should not have happened since PMI automatically cancels at 78 percent under the Homeowner 's Protection Act of 1998. I have contacted them multiple times to try and resolve the issue to no avail."
39,Once again~Servicer is intentionally trying to delay borrowers payment to increase the risk of default. CCM has had my mortgage payment since XX/XX/23 mailed on XX/XX/23 through usps. I HAVE A TRACKING NUMBER SHOWING AND A SCREEN PRINT SHOWING IT HAS YET XXXX BE PROCESSED As of XX/XX/23 they had not processed the payment. Just like last time they waited too long to process the payment and caused a late fee and there being a returned check. Although this time these are certified funds. Last time they caused a 30 day late on my credit report making me denied for financing and higher interest rates due to credit score. I believe they are intentionally trying to make me default on the loan so they may acquire my property.

This was an unintentional accident. I lost my job of 20 years and I contacted select portfolio telling them I had needed to continue the forbearance. It was continued until the forbearance ran out. I have been unable to obtain work because of this accident due to several court appearances meeting with my lawyers, etc. I contacted select portfolio servicing and they have not been of any help at all. In the last three months. Ive talked to eight different relationship managers -- -the relationship manager that was assigned to my account has never contacted me.

Finally I talked to a gentleman named XXXX, one of the eight relationship managers. He told me that the relationship manager had documented that she tried calling several times when asked what number she was calling XXXX gave a number that I have not had since the accident happened- if my relationship manager was reading my documentation and listening to my messages she wouldve found that I had a new number and I also authorized my mother to be called about anything, to be given any information, but nothing was ever done now my house is in foreclosure, It was supposed to go on the sheriffs block on the XX/XX/XXXX.

47,"I contacted Truist Bank to inquire the information needed to wire funds to make a principle payment on our mortgage. I called the customer service number provided by Truist. I was told there was a maximum daily amount that Truist would accept for principle payments. That seems to be equivalent to a prepayment penalty in terms of wire transfer fees and additional interest accrued by not being to remit the amount I wanted to. The customer service representative assured me that was Truist 's policy and could not be waived. She was also not familiar at all with the information I needed and had to call me back to provide additional instructions. My bank had additional questions regarding those instructions that I was unable to get from Truist when I called again to get it, and speaking to a second customer service representative. The policy of essentially limiting prepayment contravenes our mortgage that clearly has no penalty for prepayment and feels very predatory on the part of Truist Bank. I question the quality of supervision and training that Truist is providing to their front line customer service personnel."

56,"Lakeview Loan Servicing and XXXX XXXX  STOLE my house from me on XX/XX/XXXX while misleading me to believe I had an approved modification and had been accepting my payments for five months. This was a wrongful foreclosure. There was no sale date notice sent to me as the primary borrower. I received no communication about missing modification paperwork. There was no follow up or warning. I was completely blindsided to find out my house sold. I have most of the delinquent amount and could have reinstated the loan but no one told me what was going on. This is wrong and unethical and a violation of Alabama law. I have owned my home since XXXX. I never had a problem making payments until Covid 19 hit my county and the XXXX XXXX XXXX  I worked at cut hours and then laid me off and then closed down. I had just gone through a divorce so money was tight since I was paying by myself but I continued paying on the mortgage for almost a year by draining my 401K when I had little income coming in. When I could not afford the payment any more Lakeview offered me a forbearance where I could hold off on payments for 6-9 months and then they said they would work with me to restructure the loan or put the missed payments into a deferred balance or silent second or partial claim. When the forbearance ended I spoke with customer service and submitted modification paperwork. I was told in XX/XX/XXXX that I had been APPROVED for a loan modification, and that my new payment would be approximately {$1000.00} a month. No one said there were additional papers needed, no one said I needed to sign anything they just said I was approved and to start making payments. I began calling in a mortgage payment to Lakeview customer service monthly near the XXXX of each month. I called in payments in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. Each time I was given a confirmation code that the payment had gone through and my account had funds available to cover the mortgage payment each time I called in. I want to know what happened with these payments, where were they applied or if they were not accepted why did they give me confirmation code and fail to notify me?? 

When I tried to call in my payment in XXXX I was told that Lakeview would not accept the payment because I had not sent in the required documents. This was the first I had heard of this, no one said anything on each call that I made to make the payment, they just told me the amount and gave me the confirmation number. The agent told me that Lakeview needed information on the divorce to show that the house was awarded to me as well as other paperwork for my new job and income. I got all of the documents together and sent them overnight mail to LakeviewXXXX XXXX. I called to verify that the documents were received and they said they got them and would review and they would let me know if any other documents were needed. NO ONE SAID THAT I HAD AN UPCOMING SALE DATE. I had been APPROVED for a loan modification and making payments for 5  months!! 

No one NOTIFIED ME AS REQUIRED THAT THERE WAS A SCHEDULED SALE DATE on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Lakeview and their law firm XXXX XXXX has no proof of service for the Notice of Sale to me. My ex-wife is the one who found out the house sold from the newspaper. I asked her if she had any letters or notifications from Lakeview or the law firm regarding the foreclosure. Turns out she had come to pick up her mail multiple times and taken some of the mail relating to the mortgage. The problem is that the NOS letter states and attests and swears that I received the Notice of Sale documents via certified mail, but that is a lie. I never saw the notice, I never signed for the notice and they do not have any evidence that I was properly served and notified regarding this sale. The is a wrongful foreclosure and Lakeview engaged in unethical servicing practices."
57,"I sent a loss mitigation application to Mr Cooper on XXXX XXXX 2023, it's been 20 days and I still haven't received the response from Mr Cooper, I do not know what will be the outcome. i'm worried that it will affect my credit, as my Mortgage payment was due on XXXX XXXX, 2023 And I haven't made that payment. 

this process of loss mitigation should have been quick and I should have received a response in 2-3 days, Mr Cooper is not cooperating and is not responding to my loss mitigation application in which I requested to give me a forbearance for next six months as I recently suffered from XXXX and I do not have money to pay for mortgage reason being I didn't do business when I was suffering from XXXX, and it will take me some time to get back on my feet, so I'm just asking for more time to get back on my feet and mr and Mr Cooper is taking is taking advantage of that"
58,"Since XXXX, my mortgage was originally with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had a series of hardships I experienced in addition to loss of income during COVID. My mortgage payments fell drastically behind that in XXXX of XXXX, I was almost up to {$68000.00} dollars behind in payments. I had attempted to make payments however they would send my money back. XXXX XXXX stated I had to go through loss mitigation processes which I kept submitting paperwork to no decision ( even when they said it would take 30 days ). In late XXXX of XXXX, I was informed that my loan was transferred to Carrington Mortgage Services. When I contacted Carrington, they had explained I was in pre-foreclosure and to submit a new loss mitigation packet with them. I had explained to them at this time that I had actively been in a loss mitigation process with XXXX XXXX when my mortgage was transferred again. I set out to compile on the necessary documents to restart the loss Mitigation process with Carrington. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Carrington to ask about my application. They stated I was in active foreclosure with a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX which is less than a month away. I asked what had happened so fast and they informed me that I had been in active foreclosure since XXXX of XXXX. They told me I received process sever paperwork. I or my husband never received process server paperwork and was never informed I was in an active foreclosure. They did not explain the process to me. I asked what my options were and they did not tell me anything other than to fill out the loss mitigation package or contact mortgage assistance relief fund. I knew that the loss Mitigation package halts the foreclosure however they told me that if underwriting determined I was not eligible for any options, the foreclosure auction sale date would still stand. I was adamant about not going into bankruptcy or being foreclosed on and was not given any information or options. I had no choice and was forced to make the decision to sell my home. They have withheld giving me and my realtor my payoff quote saying they need to get it from the attorney and that Im being charged an excessive amount of fees. Also I never received the notice about the auction date for XX/XX/XXXX. I found out about it because the cleaning lady was served papers from the HOA saying we were served for foreclosure auction. This process has caused us much distress but we are going out best to save our financial lives out of this mess. They claimed to want to be of assistance when in fact they were not providing information that I was already in active foreclosure."
59,"Claim department I have forwarded my insurance claim money to the mortgage company and they received it on XX/XX/XXXX as yet XX/XX/XXXX they have not sent me the money that is owed to me and my XXXX. I call almost everyday and get a different answer. They dont communicate if information is missing, I call everyday almost. Mailed to the wrong address, returned, shredded and 5 days to reissue. That was the story on XX/XX/XXXX still not sent or receivedIm beyond frustrated, this has affected my health and well being I not only want this money forthwith I want something for the injustice and their lack of consideration and incompetence."
60,"We purchased a home with an FHA loan in XX/XX/2022. After two months with the initial lender, our loan was transferred to Rushmore Loan Management. Rushmore mishandled our escrow by grossly underestimating our county tax bill. The company initially lowered our monthly payment and sent an escrow refund based on the erroneous information. They paid the tax bill in XX/XX/2022, then my loan was transferred to a new servicer, "" XXXX XXXX ''. XXXX XXXX also mishandled my account by failing to pay my insurance on time. Because my home is in the state of Florida, my insurance agebt advised I would not be reinstated if the policy was canceled. I had to pay out of pocket to keep my insurance active. During this interaction, I learned my monthly payment will increase substantially due to the large deficit in the escrow account. We are first time homeowners and very concerned about the frequent changing of servicers and mishandling of escrow. Please investigate this issue."
61,"I am having trouble with making my payments with SPS, I had gone thru a financial hardship due to XXXX XXXX where I had lost income and suffered job loss during my time of being infected with XXXX. During this time, I kept communication with SPS where they placed me in a Forbearance program pushing my payments for several months. After my financial hardship was over and I was able to resume making my payments I applied for mortgage assistance and was later approved for a trial plan modification on XX/XX/XXXX. I received the trial plan modification documents and proceeded to make the payments on the account as instructed. My first trial payment was not due until XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to make the XXXX trial payment on XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX XXXX ( Please see attached receipt of payment ) after I had made the payment, I called SPS to make sure the payment was received and applied. Well, after several weeks and after numerous calls trying to track the payment, they informed me the payment was not received even after I sent SPS the confirmation receipt thru XXXX XXXX. SPS informed me to try to send the payment to them again which I did and on XX/XX/XXXX I sent them another payment thru Wire using the payment instructions provided by SPS representatives. At this point I figured my account was fine after making XXXX payments thru certified funds. 

SPS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Utah XXXX -- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX : UT I then later received a letter stating they had closed out my Loan Modification due to Nonpayment even though I had made XXXX payments on the trial modification. Recently I applied again for assistance but within 3 days they denied my request and refused to remove the foreclosure date on my account set for XX/XX/XXXX. I feel this is in violation of XXXX XXXX Laws as stated on your CFPB site as well as a violation of my Homeowners XXXX of rights law set to protect me from lenders abusing and miss placing my payments and proceeding with foreclosure."
62,I filed a complaint about them holding my principal payments in a suspense account instead of applying them to the principal on my loan. You contacted them and they moved the funds yesterday and today they have moved them back. I have contacted the company and they don't know what is going on. I don't want to have to wait another 4 months to have them attempt to remedy the problem.
63,"A payoff was requested of XXXXPHH Mortgage. They requested a copy of the appraisal in order to issue the payoff. Their repeated requests are unreasonable and not legal according to my new lender XXXX XXXX Bank. I have a loan approval that has expired due to the continued incompetence of all involved at both the payoff department and XXXX department at PHH mortgage. Contact information XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. They are illegally requesting the appraiser falsify the appraisal report to show the home is a three bedroom, where it is currently showing as a two bedroom simply because of hallway access to a bathroom. An addendum is attached to the appraisal explaining the two versus three bedroom discrepancy."
64,"XXXX I was put on a trial loan modification. I paid XXXX, and XXXX but I wasnt able to pay the third one. A law firm sent me a letter stating they were gon na auction my home off in order to satisfy their clients interest in a pass through trust. They have right to foreclose. I have not signed any contract with them for a loan. Privity of contract states that the only parties that can enforce a contract are the original parties to the contract. They were not a party to the original contract. Even if they bought the loan they stilll have no right to enforce the contract."
65,"I have made a payment through XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX that has been confirmed to have posted to you on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$1200.00}. It is not in suspense. I have called multiple times and nothing happens. The customer service people can only email the cashiering dept. This amount should be in suspense until the other half of my payment is completed. 

This is ludicrous that I need to continue to call to see what the XXXX is going on. You are welcome to check the account history bc there have been nothing but problems since the merger."
66,"I am filing a new claim because my original claim filed XX/XX/XXXX to try and stop the sale of my house on XX/XX/XXXX was responded to by the company Franklin Credit on XX/XX/XXXX and my claim, without any option to appeal was summarily rubber stamp closed. It is disheartening that an agency that is supposed to be for the consumer, didn't even take the time to read the response and that it did NOT answer the question of the claim. I am attaching the documents I prepared to appeal thier non-answer, taking much time away from trying to fight this, filing emergency XXXX to stop it, etc... only to find out I can only leave "" feedback ''. Please see my response to original claim number XXXX. I have attached all the documents so you'll have context. 

I am in receipt of Franklin Credit Management Corporations ( Franklin Credit ) CFPB response to my initial claim filed on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. I received notification of the response on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. Although I appreciate the response submitted, however well-crafted, is filled with inaccuracies, half-truths and fails to answer the question of the claim filed. I will point out inaccuracies, as well as again, ask for an adequate response/action from Franklin Credit and appeal to the CFPB for sanctions against Franklin Credit and proper remedy given to me due to the continuously irresponsible and egregious actions by Franklin Credit . 

In the second paragraph, it is accurate that my late husband agreed to a HELOC through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a total line amount available of {$230000.00}. However, Franklin Credit states it was to refinance an existing mortgage loan, which is untrue, inaccuracy # 1. Has nothing to do with my CFPB complaint today. 

I confirm that he did file XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX while XXXX 2nd was with original issuer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As anyone who was involved in the housing market crash, this filing was not unusual given the circumstances, and done so legally. Has nothing to do with my CFPB complaint today.

Per Franklin Credit on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX went bankrupt and sold our loan for pennies on the dollar to Bosco Credit LLC. Thats when communication stopped and I never received a bill or any notices from this new lender I personally tried calling XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to find out where the loan was going, but the phone just rang. So we waited for notice, new statement and I do not remember ever seeing anything, never received a phone call. According to Franklin Credit, they began servicing the loan on behalf of Bosco Credit LLC on XX/XX/XXXX. I can not confirm nor deny this as we knew nothing, again were sent nothing about them taking it over or a new statement asking for payment. The dispute over how much of the line was used still remains in contention, as I can not clearly make sense of these statements and thus far Franklin Credit has not shown actual proof of funds dispersed, theyve relied solely on the modification agreement signed in XXXX in a very stressful time, so I wont address that here. Has nothing to do with my CFPB complaint today. 

In the fifth paragraph, I confirm that the XXXX XXXX XXXX  was dismissed in XX/XX/XXXX. It is disingenuous to assert that XXXX XXXX did not contact Franklin Credit. Again, we didnt know Franklin Credit existed, so how could we contact Franklin Credit ? I can attest with certainty that Franklin Credit never contacted me at my number, and I was married to XXXX XXXX for 33 years prior to his death, and any phone message on his phone that had to do with financials, he would have 100 % told me, forwarded the message to me, write a note to me with all the information. None of that ever happened. I dont know if Franklin Credit called him or not- did anyone leave a message? The loan is in my husbands name and I was never notified of the debt. Again, this has nothing to do with my CFPB complaint today. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Franklin Credit filed a notice of default, the first I had heard from them, and acknowledge I received the notice. As Franklin states the amount was {$380000.00}. Again, didnt know who or how to find them and get in touch with them. And then when the pandemic grossly inflated home prices, here comes Franklin Credit marching along with all the XXXX 2nds coming for homes and families. Has nothing to do with my CFPB complaint today. I would also like to point out, in Franklin Credits ( Exhibit F ), which Ive attached pertinent pages noted as XXXX XXXX XXXX, on page XXXX under XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  with ( or exception from ) Civil Code Section 2923.55 and Authorization of Agent ( For Notice of Default ), the reason marked is The provisions of Civil Code 2923.55 do not apply because X the loan is not secured by a first mortgage or first deed of trust that encumbers real property described in Civil Code Section 2924.15 ( a ). I am not an attorney, but I can read, and it would appear to me that their reason when they tried this the first attempt in XXXX is inaccurate- there is a 2nd mortgage which encumbers the real property. Again, not an attorney but it surely looks like this was also done incorrectly. Has nothing to do with my CFPB complaint today.

I acknowledge that my attorneys office contacted Franklin Credit to submit a modification request and mitigation. I cant speak to the owners, I dont know who they are. I acknowledge that Franklin Credit did return to my attorneys office with a trial modification shown in ( XXXX XXXX ). I confirm that I did reject it- and was then forced to file XXXX XXXX. It would appear that Franklin Credit and its owners are very benevolent in granting a trial modification that I just simply rejected. Here is the offer and the truth : Down payment due in 30 days from letter date of {$150000.00}. Thats correct, nothing in the trial modification means anything unless I magically produce {$150000.00} in cash ( certified check ). Not to mention there would still be a large principal and then a balloon payment of {$130000.00}, and a monthly payment of {$2000.00} due 17 days later from the {$150000.00}. Here again is Franklin Credits artful language which left all that detail out of the letter and buried it in ( XXXX XXXX  ) which Ive attached ( notice the mailing address is incorrect ). How can anyone with a straight face think this was a reasonable offer of modification? Its truly the worst part of corporate capitalism greed. Franklin Credit made it crystal clear they had no intention of working with me as each time my attorney went to court, the court was told that Franklin Credit was, in fact, working with me and had offered a trial modification, then they came back again, which isnt mentioned in the letter, for a second modification offer of {$50000.00} down payment and $ XXXX mo XXXX Again, if I had {$50000.00} I likely wouldnt be I this situation, but then the monthly payment is unreasonable. They made their intentions clear and my only remedy was filing bankruptcy- they forced me into it. Due to Franklin Credits unwillingness to be genuine in their offer of reasonable mitigation, the plan became unfeasible due to the large increase in plan payment, so it was dismissed late XX/XX/XXXX. Heard nothing from Franklin Credit. Has nothing to do with my CFPB complaint today. I am willing to pay the debt if we are able to work out a reasonable loan workout that offers an affordable payment on a monthly basis. I have offered this to Franklin and was denied. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Franklin Credit posted a Notice of Trustees sale on my house. My HUD Housing Counselor informed me that a servicer must, by law, give notice of intention to foreclose with NOD and workout options prior to posting a Notice of Trustee Sale, which Franklin Credit did not comply with. Franklin Credit as much as admits to it in their response- The Notice of Trustees Sale notified XXXX XXXX that a foreclosure sale was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX and indicated the amount of unpaid balance and other charges was {$670000.00}. This represents an increase in less than 24 months of {$290000.00}. I acknowledge it was posted on XX/XX/XXXX, but as I had no prior notice that they were going to file a Trustees Sale on the property, actually nothing from them still in writing other than the ridiculous trial modification. I started calling the 1st mortgage servicer XXXX XXXX as I believed that was who had filed the notice on my house. In clearing up with a XXXX loss mitigation representative and both of us realizing that her system didnt show any notice, I realized it had to be the XXXX. Since I had no prior notices, no contacts, no phone numbers from Franklin Credit, I called the number on the notice, which is the Trustee Attorney. I left a message, and got no response and my call was never returned. Panicked, I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX, a HUD housing counseling agency for help as my attorney was no longer representing me, I was advised to call Franklin Credit and at the conclusion of our conversation, I was advised to file a complaint with CFPB for notice violation and to stop the sale of my property. The complaint was filed on XX/XX/XXXX. Much to my surprise and hope, I received a call from XXXX XXXX of Franklin Credit on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PST regarding a letter they received. On XX/XX/XXXX after receiving the message, I dialed XXXX TEN times before I was even able to get through to leave him a message, which by that time was after XXXX EST. I called the main number I found XXXX EIGHT times, left message, no response. I called on XX/XX/XXXX always busy. I called NINE times on XX/XX/XXXX, and in pure desperation, I called both numbers at least ELEVEN times on XX/XX/XXXX before finally speaking with XXXX XXXX. That is FOUR days wasted. Here is what may be the most egregious and disingenuous language in this response letter, Although foreclosure sale is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX has been notified that her account may be reviewed for available loss mitigation options if a complete application package is submitted by XXXX EST on XX/XX/XXXX. On the face of it, thats correct. Again, Franklin Credit leaves out the reality of my conversation with XXXX XXXX. It is true that after the majority of our call on the XXXX XXXX XXXX did offer to consider a review with no guarantee if I can submit a modification package within the hour. Given that I was at work that would be difficult but was prepared to leave work to do it. They were giving me unrealistic timelines to get the loan mod information back which is not offering me ample time to submit a full packet for a reasonable workout. However, what Franklin Credit has conveniently left out of this, is that I was also told that if I didnt have a very substantial amount as down payment it wont be considered- no matter when I filed or didnt file it. I asked him to clarify what that amount would be and his general response was your trial modification required a {$150000.00} down payment, its increased to {$210000.00}. As calmly as possible, I told him all of it is ridiculous and unreasonable. Who has {$210000.00} sitting in the bank and in this situation? This should be criminal. I told him there is no way I have anything close and what I clearly heard from him is without a $ 100,000+ down payment, Im wasting both our time submitting anything. As I cried hysterically, I received the notice of the Franklin Credit response to CFPB and was absolutely floored at the lengths this company will go to in glossing over the real story here. So, just like in XXXX, they forced me to file an emergency bankruptcy that didnt need to happen if they would have followed the law and actually were genuine in their words and actions. 

So, I ask, where in this response does Franklin Credit EVER answer my complaint of no notice prior to the Notice of Trustee Sale? How can they honestly believe theyve adequately addressed anything but everything that didnt answer the complaint? This company is expert at skating the truth and I am sure they take advantage of many borrowers who had no say in being thrown to these wolves with these tactics. It is crystal clear they intend to deep corporate pocket me until my XXXX daughter and I are on the streets. I have always been willing, but a person cant be willing with offers as ridiculous as these non-offers. I request CFPB look further into this for sanctions and at a minimum requiring them to start the process over with proper notice, and Ill hope against hope that maybe someone there will actually try and help me. I am asking for them to provide me the full package required as XXXX XXXX just told me documents verbally, and the opportunity to submit a loan modification application and it be reviewed so I can work with them and get a reasonable workout. I am currently working with my HUD housing counselor to get financial counseling in an effort to pay my bills and obtain a loan workout to stay in my home. I appreciate your help in resolving this matter."

69,"My mortgage company is FREEDOM MORTGAGE. I live in Florida and experienced hurricane Ian followed by hurricane Nicole in XX/XX/XXXX. We were declared a Federal Disaster Area on XX/XX/XXXX. We were told by multiple Real Estate Agents that our lender is required to give relief with a 3 month forbearance on our mortgage, thus placing these moths at the end of the loan. And our next due date would be XX/XX/XXXX. My husband, XXXX, Called Freedom Mortgage in XXXX. He requested information directly about the forbearance that would relieve our payment and move it to the end of the loan. They told him they could do it and would be happy to set that up for us. This was the end of the call. We did not pay XXXX Mortgage but did continue to pay into our escrow. We had not heard anything more and called back in XXXX to see if we needed to complete anything or if everything was still good to go. XXXX ensured via phone call that we were not going to owe this money and we were told no, on a recorded line. They did request documents for us to fill out, they did not send them until XXXX XXXX. These documents asked for things like paycheck check stubs and bank statements. We called and asked why would we need to fill these forms our when the state was declared a state of emergency, the agency replied that we were correct and not to fill out the forms. We also paid into the escrow XXXX all before the end of XXXX. I called Freedom mortgage back after my husband on XX/XX/XXXX as I was worried, we did not receive collecting calls or any late fees during this time but was still very unsettling. I spoke to XXXX # XXXX. During this call he was very egger to get to the bottom of it but told me that the VA is the reason we can not complete this forbearance of placing three months in the end of the loan. He stated the VA will not allow them, Freedom Mortgage to do this. I asked why we were not told in XXXX, he stated the agents that we were dealing with should have been trained. I asked what we were to do as multiple agents told us this was okay and it is not XXXX. He was adamant there was nothing and we would owe the money, explaining that they just give us a break and then ask for it all after that 3 months. I let him know I would have just paid if that were the case. He told me that different agents applied for different things like covid relief which we did not ask for and was not a thing past XXXX XXXX. He was going to go back and review all the recorded calls to verify what I was being told and would return my call. I asked him on a recorded line if I should pay as I was nervous he stated if you pay it will go towards XXXX, XXXX XXXX which are the months you are trying to place at the end of the loan so you should wait. So I did. I also waited for his call which never came. I called multiple times and no return. While waiting for his call, I called the Veterans Benefits Administration to find out what we can do to get this approved as XXXX told me it was them who said no. I spoke to the VA Home load department directly with the VA in the Loan protection Policy/Procedure department. They told me under no circumstances can they tell Freedom mortgage to not do something or to do something but they encourage them to take care of the veterans. They stated there is many calls & complaints about this but ensured me that the VA doesn't hold the power to make them do anything. They provided me with Special relief following a hurricane Circular which is basically show what measures mortgagees may employ to provide relief, which again XXXX told me they told freedom mortgage no. XXXX never took our call or called us back, we requested to talk to someone over XXXX, we believe XXXX was a supervisor as that is what we asked for when we talked to XXXX. Late XXXX we now have XXXX # XXXX she voiced the findings that XXXX notated our account with. Many wrong things told to us that shouldn't have been. Also let us know that what we called for in XXXX was never actually submitted for. Saying they applied for Covid relief which they should have been doing past XX/XX/XXXX. At this time I owed XXXX. She told me about options with splitting this up over 6 months or 12 months. I told her this was not an option. I need it how I requested in XXXX and was told it would happen. I told her my % could not increase, that would also not be an option. While on the phone she applied for what we needed which was 3 months placed at the end of the loan and no change to our %. She said she would know in 5 business days and it would likely be approved and she apologized for everything that happened and ensured me that the agents would receive training. She asked me to call her between XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I did. No answer or return call. Same thing that happened with XXXX. No one could get her on the phone, they asked if they could help. I wanted XXXX. wouldn't happen. Late last week I had an agent tell me they would help me as they can see notes on the screen and told me that they were reviewing my request and a decision was not made yet and they should have sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX. After hanging up I thought to myself HOW, I talked to XXXX and she didn't apply for what I needed until late XXXX. So I called back. The agent told me that what XXXX says she applied for would not happen and I needed to pay the money back sooner than later. I kindly ended the call and reached out to a lawyer and gave the information to him. I would prefer not to go this route and have things settled the way they told me they would be. Thank you for listening."
70,"Rushmore Loan Services has repeatedly made account errors on my loan files. I have 4 loans at Rushmore Loan Management Services ( https : //www.rushmorelm.com/ ). I am NOT able to access any of my loan data using their on line system. Each and every time I MUST call in, spend 1 or more hours on the phone to deal with their offshore "" support team ''. These people are not well trained and the impact is often times I need to call back in to get the critical information I need in order to manage my accounts.

Just last week Rushmore made a substantial miscalculation to one of my loan accounts which caused my payment to increase {$330.00} per month! This is financially impactful and an error not caused by me. THEY must make this right!! 

I wish my broker NEVER referred these loans to Rushmore and I will be contacting the lender to have these loans moved to another processing company"
71,"Lender relabeled a mortgage as a "" Home Equity Installment Loan '' and are telling me that, for example, that they are applying {$730.00} for my XX/XX/2023 payment to my Outstanding Principal, yet they show on my XX/XX/2023 account statement that they only applied {$440.00} to my account principal for XX/XX/2023. 

The numbers are wrong and it was supposed to be a mortgage. The difference has amounted to more than {$15000.00} so far. T The lender is PNC BANK."
72,"I had received solicitations from Carrington Home Mortgage for some time regarding refinancing my home to get cash out and pay off additional debts. I had phone calls and received solicitations when logging into the Carrington Home Mortgage portal to make my payments. 

On XX/XX/2022 I discussed my options with a Mortgage Loan Officer out of Arizona. His name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. We reviewed my current income, my current debts and decided to move forward with a Second Mortgage through Carrington Home Mortgage, as he stated that all look to be in line with their requirements and I could get up to 85 % of the home value which their portal stated I had a estimated home value of {$480000.00}. I wanted enough to get my current debts paid off and we discussed putting the Loan to Value on an estimated {$450000.00} so that we would be okay with paying off my debts. This say week I received a debt collection call from Carrington Home Mortgage saying I was late on a my first mortgage and a payment was due or information would be sent to the credit agencies, however I have until the 15th of each month to make a payment. This was a violation of XXXX, as this was an unfair call and deceptive knowing I have additional days to make my payment. I informed the agent on that call that I was getting a second mortgage and was also going to be making my payment online. I was very confused as to why I was receiving this call when there was clear communication with XXXX of Carrington Home Mortgage Loan Officers that I was making payment to them and had never missed a payment. 

XXXX sent over documents which were signed and sent back, he also gave me a list of documents I needed to upload. I proceeded to upload requested documents and XXXX asked me to email them to him as well as it would be easier. As I reviewed the Initial Disclosures, there was an error and XXXX said this would be corrected on the Closing Documents. Essentially {$1700.00} in fees would be removed when the loan was in processing and mentioned I would need to pay for an appraisal which would be {$550.00} and could be put on a credit card that we are paying off. All of this communication was via email. During these email exchanges I let XXXX know that I needed to contact my old employer for two years of W2 's and was able to get those documents uploaded, I also send him two years of tax transcripts and returns to help with the loan processing. 

After all documents were uploaded and everything XXXX mentioned needed to be signed were signed, I asked what were the next steps via email and he said all is great, we will just wait for processing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed XXXX to see what was going on because I had not heard anything nor had been informed of an appraisal. He responded that there was no need for anything and he or the processor would reach out to me with next steps. The next day XXXX talked to me and he forgot to email the link for the appraisal and because it's a 2nd that the appraisal should only be {$220.00}. He then sent a link to me and I was able to go in and pay for an appraisal which was listed as {$550.00} and he said there could be glitch in the system but to pay it anyway and I put the {$550.00}, on the XXXX XXXX Credit Card which was being paid off with the 2nd mortgage. This was via email exchange. He said that at the end of the day, he would made sure it was squared away either way on the mortgage or to pay for it. 

On XX/XX/2022 I had an appraiser come out to the home and perform an appraisal. The value came back as {$450000.00} on the Cost Approach, and {$430000.00} on the Sales Comparison Approach. 

I emailed XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to ask which valuation Carrington would be using for the mortgage and received no response. On the same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I got a notice of incomplete application and email XXXX again to ask why I was receiving that. I had already uploaded documents, I had already signed documents, I had an appraisal and then was receiving a notice of incomplete application. 

I received no response from XXXX and replied to the email address where I got the notice of incomplete application, this was XXXX manager XXXX XXXX. I also attempted to call XXXX and did not receive an answer. This all took place on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I attempted to call XXXX several times over the next week with no response. I also called another loan officer with Carrington Home Mortgage who answered via their general line and told me he found the loan application, and that XXXX had not taken action on it. He gave me the contact information for XXXX XXXX, and I told him I had already attempted to contact XXXX XXXX. That loan officer then gave me the XXXX 's contact information, that XXXX is named XXXX XXXX. 

I called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and left a message, and then I emailed XXXX and XXXX once again. This time I told them all docs have been uploaded and signed, nothing is left for me to do and I have not heard back from anyone regarding my 2nd mortgage. I was hopeful to have this process done and approved within the first week of XXXX as XXXX had initially stated that is our timeframe. 

XXXX finally emailed me back less than 10 minutes after my email and told me the loan had not fallen off his radar, but it was in processing and he would let me know the status ASAP by the end of the day. 

I waited until XX/XX/XXXX to reach back out because again, I had not heard anything from XXXX and we were coming up on 30 days since submitting the loan application with no response. I emailed again on XX/XX/XXXX and asked if he was too busy to help, could he get the loan to a loan officer who would help. I also left a voice mail for XXXX and did not hear back. 

I am now past 30 days from initial application, and this is a violation of ECOA. I understand that Carrington Mortgage sent the Notice of Incomplete Application, however this is a false Notice of Incomplete Application to extend their timing and allowance for compliance. The notice was stating I needed to upload documents when had been uploaded and this tactic is used often with mortgage companies to avoid having to follow compliance rules and regulations. 

I worked in the Mortgage Compliance space for many years and find what I have experienced to be a violation on UDAAP, ECOA and privacy ( as the loan officer asked me to provide documents outside of the secure portal ) I would like to have my loan closed so that I can get the high APR debts paid and also the money back for the appraisal. This process along each step and communication was reassured by XXXX XXXX that things were moving and here I am on XX/XX/XXXX, with no updates on the 2nd Mortgage. I have lost a significant amount of trust in Carrington Home Mortgage, and this includes receiving that collections call about the XXXX payment which was made before the XXXX. 

Because I am in the industry, I am aware of CFPB actions taken against Carrington for other violations under the CARES Act, and I would hope this is a one off case that I am experiencing but they are loosing consumer trust and financially impacted me. I ask that the CFPB look at this complaint seriously and consider how these violation may also be happening to other consumers or customers of Carrington Home Mortgage. 

If I am making payments to this Mortgage Servicer and Mortgage Lender, I expect to be treated with respect, in a timely manner, and that this company has knowledge and actively is participating in training and awareness campaigns for compliance to lending and servicing regulations. 

The lack of communication, the lack of character, and the lack of understanding to their mortgage lending and servicing rules including payments is shocking and I am expected to pay for my mortgage throughout the next 28 years on my first mortgage, and do want to complete my refinance to pay off my debts and this would be 30 years of payments. 

Throughout this loan process I was assured that all debts that I discussed with XXXX would be able to be paid, it was just a matter of getting the loan closed. I am still paying my higher APR on debts, and additionally added debt to the XXXX XXXX XXXX per the Loan Officers statements because that would be included in the pay off."
73,"Hello. 
Our mortgage was issues XXXX. The original purchase price was XXXX. XXXX our remaining balance was XXXX, which is 79 %. I submitted an application to remove PMI, because our LTV ratio based on the ORIGINAL purchase price was less than 80 %. The mortgage company is insisting we provide a list of significant upgrades, whoever this should not be necessary because of our LTV ratio. I have tried to explain this to them over email and phone multiple times but the people that handle the request do not have a phone number so the people I call can not help me. I have learned that our mortgage is backed by XXXX XXXX and through phone conversations they have told me that the XXXX XXXX servicing system does not render a property value ( which I dont understand but it seems to be the issue ) I have a right to verify that the current value is at least equal to the original value by a restricted appraisal or a BPO but the mortgage company need to order this appraisal or BPO and they are not willing to do this."
74,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against Freedom Mortgage Corporation ( "" Freedom Mortgage '' ), a mortgage servicing company that I currently have my home loan with for the above mentioned legal address and loan number. On XX/XX/, I submitted a letter of complaint to Freedom Mortgage via their online service portal, detailing my dissatisfaction with their service and the issues I have experienced with their escrow department. However, in a call I had with a representative named "" XXXX '' in their escalations team, I was informed that they were not handling my complaint and did not know where it was. As a result, I sent the same letter to their email on XX/XX/, and have not received any acknowledgement of receipt or response as of the date of this letter. 

In the aforementioned letter to Freedom Mortgage, I expressed my disappointment with their service and the trouble I have had with their escrow department, including an erroneous escrow surplus check I received in XX/XX/, an escrow shortage notice I received in XX/XX/, and the misapplication of my extra payments to my loan principal. Despite numerous phone calls and requests for an explanation, I have not received a satisfactory resolution to these issues, and I am deeply concerned about the handling of my escrow account. 

Furthermore, on XX/XX/, I also requested to have a copy of my loan agreement sent to me, but as of this writing, I have not received it. This lack of response and unresponsiveness is unacceptable and only adds to the growing list of issues I have had with Freedom Mortgage. 

I am seeking the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions in resolving these issues and holding Freedom Mortgage accountable for their poor service. As a borrower, I have the right to be treated fairly and with respect, and I believe that Freedom Mortgage has violated these rights by their handling of my account. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I have enclosed a copy of my original letter to Freedom Mortgage for your review, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Below is the body of the letter I submitted on the Freedom Mortgage online service portal. This letter was also emailed to a member of the Freedom Mortgage Escalation team.

To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the service I have received from Freedom Mortgage. I have been a customer of your company for several years now, and I have never experienced such frustration and inconvenience as I have with your escrow department. In XXXX of this year, I received a check for {$680.00} from your escrow department, which was supposed to be a surplus because your department had determined that my real estate taxes were only {$80.00}. However, in XXXX, I received another letter from your company informing me of an escrow shortage of {$890.00}. When I called customer service to inquire about this, I was told to mail a check for the shortage amount and mark in the memo "" for escrow account, '' which I did promptly. The check was cashed by your organization on XX/XX/. Since then, I have made two extra payments of {$1000.00}, but your company has not corrected my payment and has not applied the proper curtailments to my loan principal as expected. Instead, I am still being charged {$1000.00} as a payment. I demand that you fix my escrow account immediately. Furthermore, I was misled by your company this year, and I feel that my rights as a borrower under the Dodd Frank Act have been violated. I demand that you retroactively pay my curtailment principal for the months of XXXX and XX/XX/2023 rather than apply the curtailment for this month, since your company did not properly apply my escrow payment on XX/XX/2023. I do not believe the Freedom Mortgage Escrow and Customer Service representives are properly trained in handling my requests over the phone, as every time I call in, they try to peddle me to another department or ask that I submit an online request. I have spent countless hours on the phone with your representives trying to resolve this issue, and I am tired of the inconvenience and frustration that your company has served me. As a result, I do not wish to speak over the phone with any representatives of Freedom Mortgage. Instead, I request that you communicate your action plan to fix your mistake through my email at XXXX. I believe that this will allow for a more efficient and effective communication process and will help to resolve this matter in a timely and satisfactory manner. I understand that your company is the largest provider of VA loans, but I feel that my business has been reduced to just a number to you. I hope that you will take my concerns seriously and take the necessary steps to correct this situation promptly. 
Lastly, I want to express that if your company can not find the time, or competence, to correct your Escrow department 's errors when I make the XX/XX/2023 payment, I will have no choice but to pursue complaints with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions. As a customer, I expect to receive proper and fair treatment from my mortgage company. If your company is unable or unwilling to provide that, I will have no other recourse but to escalate my complaints to the proper regulators. 
This letter is being submitted online through the Freedom Mortgage online customer service portal on freedommortgage.com. I hereby certify that the above information is accurate and truthful to the best of my knowledge. This letter serves as a legal document and a formal notice of my dissatisfaction with the service provided by your company. I reserve all rights to pursue legal action and/or file a complaint with the appropriate regulatory agencies if this matter is not resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner."

And that so would need to send a email. So I emailed my closing papers, the XXXX county tax with the right parcel number. Please help me"
76,"Hello. Once again we are having problems with payment issues with BSI Financial. All you have to do is XXXX them and see their rating and all the negative comments about this company and how they do business. I dont understand why XXXX XXXX them to continue to do business. We were granted a forebearance due to XXXX XXXX XXXX due to XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. We we forced to place a stop payment on our checking account bc they hit it during the forebearance and caused us overdraft fees... they too charged us overdraft fees even though we were in forebearance! We attempted to start auto draft back up in XXXX and thats when the nightmare started. We keep getting that the payments were revoked so we would end up mailing after many calls asking what was going on. We would be told it was fixed. Then the next month would happen and once again there was a problem drafting. All the fees keep being charged to us. In XXXX and XXXX they were drafting multiple times with the same letters stating we were revoking the payments! We werent. We would leave messages with our so called XXXX 's and they NEVER called us back. We have had 2 during this process : XXXX XXXX and XXXX. They give us so called direct extentions but when you go through customer service..they send you to a "" dead '' mailbox with nothing but a Beep. No name, etc. We have never over the past 8 months got a return call, email or text. They sure do know how to send letters telling you they are collecting fees though! XXXX XXXX we called yet again and the XXXX that answered their XXXX # said they could no longer talk to us unless I emailed a HANDWRITTEN NOTE to their customer service email address. I did that. Then the next day we were told to go to our bank and get a letter stating there was NO blocks on our account. We did that on XX/XX/2023. They told us nothing was there to stop payments. We called back and the XXXX rep said they were going to cover all bases and RESIGN us up for auto drafts and that was done on XX/XX/2023. They have attempted to debit our account 4 times since those dates and we keep getting Revoked by customer and today we get a letter that says "" Unable to Locate ''!!! What does that even mean?? They signed us up AGAIN on XX/XX/2023. ALL of their letters come with collection notices for FEES. There is one saying we are 30 days late for XXXX On XX/XX/2023 we costly spent the money to overnight 2 checks to them for mortgage payments. We have not heard anything back from them. I have written, faxed, and emailed 4 different people at one time all letters, documents and XXXX notice of payments. We think these people are in the XXXX  business and ruining peoples lives with negative credit reporting. We have filed a complaint with the XXXX  and we have a call in now to XXXX  to see if we can do anything against the fact they are paid to XXXX their accounts but obviously cant or dont know how. Our Bank said the problem is NOT on their end but the STOP is on their end because they see NO RECORD of them attempting to draft our accounts. IF that was the case... why havent they seen it ... why didnt it fix itself when we were resigned up on XX/XX/2023??"
77,"XXXX XXXX XXXX denied my many, passionate attempts for a Loan Modification, resulting in a Foreclosure. While no money settlement, at this time, would seem to make up for the loss in household goods, and the actual house... seeking XXXX in damages seems like a logical course. This was our first Mortgage experience, and never did I expect such shady tactics to achieve their end goal - Short Sale or Foreclosure. I have photo evidence of people unlawfully entering the house, while we were out of town - to prepare the house for resale. Time was essential, and this Bank did not care in the least of my pleas for more time. XX/XX/2015 was when this occurred, as far as the house be resold. XXXX through XX/XX/2015 was when the un-authorized entry and access to the house took place. I only managed to get one truck load of our stuff out before the house went to be re-sold. No notice of where many of my and my Spouse 's sentimental items were taken, but they were taken for certain. My High School ring was left, and has my name and social security number engraved in it. I would indicate that their acquisition of our things was tantamount to theft."
78,"my PMI was not automatically canceled once the ratio reached 78 %. 
i am currently at 74 %, 4 % past the supposedly automatic PMI Termination level. 
I requested the 4 % over payment be either refunded or applied to my mortgage principal and was told no by the mortgage company."
79,"Freedom Mortgage currently services my mortgage. I completed their process to have PMI removed from my account. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating the PMI on my loan has been terminated. I called to clarify my XXXX payment amount, and the representative did not know about the cancellation and referred my account to another department. I verified on Freedom Mortgage 's website the funds in my escrow were sufficient to make a PMI payment before subtracting that amount from my XXXX payment. I was later called and told I was past due by the amount of the PMI. The representative confirmed that the PMI had been canceled and there were sufficient escrow funds to make payment. At this time, I had already remitted my XXXX payment, again subtracting the PMI. After the representative advised I was past due, I logged onto the Freedom Mortage website and made a payment equivalent to two months of PMI. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX advising I did not make my full monthly payment. The letter stated, "" To apply the payment to your account, we have reduced the escrow portion of your payment by the difference between the full payment and the payment received. '' Today, my credit score went down XXXX points because Freedom Mortgage reported me as past due. Given that I have made both monthly payments and they sent a letter advising my payment was applied, I dispute this as proper credit reporting."

83,"I the consumer applied for a Navy Federal Refinance loan and was denied. According to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Adverse action against a consumer is against the law. This is codified in 15 USC 1691c and is pursuant to civil liability under 15 USC 1691k. I have proof of discrimination by Navy Federal due to their response by the company. See attached. Navy Federal is in violation of 15 USC 1642, USC 1681m and 12 CFR 1002 because I the consumer made an application in good faith but credit was not issued. My SSN was used and I again received no benefit. This is proof of Fraudulent activity on Navy Federal behalf. I also, have additional information of certified mail sent to them by me to resolve this matter given credit can not be denied. I will await response back to fix this issue and will follow up with violation fees and damages caused by being denied. Thank you."
84,"Last XXXX bank of America offered to enroll me in the mortgage deferral program as someone who was having hardships due to Covid since I live with someone who is XXXX so I signed up online. They are now telling me that instead of the mortgage deferral program, they signed me up for the mortgage forbearance program, something I did not sign up for and something not mentioned on the call when I signed up. They said the mortgage deferral program ended last XXXX, so there was no way I could have signed up for it. But I just checked the same automated line I used to sign up the deferral program to see if I made some sort of error. I did not. As of today, XXXX XXXX XXXX  they are still offering to sign people up for the mortgage deferral program that they claim ended in XX/XX/XXXX. I brought this to their attention at the end of XXXX so if this was an honest mistake on their part then why are they still doing it after this issue was brought to their attention weeks ago? 

I feel like I was scammed into a program I never intended to sign up for in the first place. If they would have asked me if I wanted to enter the mortgage forbearance program I would have said no. Now they want me to pay the full amount ASAP, or modify my mortgage which would raise my interest rate. I do not want to raise my interest rate."
85,"My loan was purchased by Newrez LLC in XX/XX/XXXX. When I went to make my initial payment my mortgage had suddenly increased from XXXX to XXXX. I called to inquire about the increase and was told it was due to a negative escrow account balance. Once I received my escrow account information I found out ( through no fault of my own ) my fall XXXX taxes paid in closing to XXXX XXXX XXXX had not been applied to my escrow account nor had they been paid to the county. I have a previous complaint regarding this issue and XXXX XXXX has admitted fault to this and has issued a check payable to Newrez for the full amount of XXXX. 

The issue I am having is that my mortgage payment is not reflecting my homestead deduction or my reduced homeowners insurance policy. The escrow account divided over 12 months would only be XXXX dollars more a month, not XXXX. They are tacking on an additional XXXX dollars that I have been assured would be adjusted and explained it was due to various reasons. I have talked to around 10 different agents about the issue of my incorrect mortgage payment. 
I was told to submit my documents through the "" contact us '' portal on the website. I did this as well as faxed them and sent them directly to a managers ( XXXX XXXX ) email. I have been told they were received only for the next agent to say they didn't see them until I explained I have sent them 3 different ways and then every agent would say they eventually found them. There has been no adjustment made to my account to reflect my homestead exemption or my decreased homeowners insurance and it has now been almost 3 months. 

I have been paying my regular payment of XXXX with a manager approval each month and it has been accepted. Despite this I keep getting letters in the mail warning that my account could go into default even though each representative has said that is not correct and "" not to worry '' about what I receive in the mail. This is highly irregular and worrisome. Almost every representative I have spoken to has suggested that I hold off on making any payments until my account is updated. This too seems suspicious.

I have sent the check for my negative escrow balance as of today and I am already worried that my account will not reflect that either. Since XXXX I have spoken with Newrez weekly, sometimes multiple times a week with no change. The last agent I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX stated they should have already done an escrow analysis and that he would request one to be done immediately. This didn't make sense as they had yet to receive my escrow payment yet and I am concerned they will refuse to run an escrow analysis once the payment is received on Monday."
86,"XX/XX/XXXX company sent school tax payment to incorrect address ( clearly marked on letter address had changed XX/XX/XXXX payment returned to company XXXX issued escrow surplus check to me XX/XX/XXXX contacted company to inquire about payment, no correspondence ever received about missed payment XX/XX/XXXX I made/return payment to company to re-issue payment.

88,"I opened my home loan in XXXXFifth Third Bank took over my loan. Since, I did have a couple of late payments up to XXXX or XXXX. Every year since, and up to now, the company has claimed that I've continued to make late payments without the due late fees, and they also claimed that I wanted to sell my house and they assisted me with the sale which incurred over {$200.00} in fees that they started collecting two and three times a year since XXXX. The company knew my age and knew this was my first mortgage loan. So, I stopped sending money orders and started completing payments online. I felt like this would keep a better trail. Whenever I paidd my loan at the beginning and end of the same month since the bill was due on the first of each month, they would put my second payment towards principal instead of applying it to the next month as I indicated in the notes section of my online payment. To their defense, they would tell me that they can't see the notes-but this is their online portal. I was also told that I could make payments over the phone for free in which I would receive a notification later that there was charges for making payments over the phone instead of by mail or online. I wasn't able to afford a phone for a while so I used my neighbor 's phone number-they called her so much that she changed her number. So, since around XXXX, I haven't had a number on file, but fifth third has been sending me junk mail and my monthly mortgage payment notification by mail. In XXXX of XXXX, I got an online message when I logged in to setup my mortgage payment. The message informed me that I would have to download their new app or I wouldn't be able to login online after XX/XX/XXXX. So, while online in XXXX, XXXX, I went ahead and setup payments up to XXXX, XXXX. So, in XXXX, XXXX, I downloaded the new app, wasn't able to login with same credentials so I called number provided. I was assisted and was able to login, but then before accessing my account, an error message appears "" well that didn't go as planned. Please try again. If this is your second try, go ahead and message us or call XXXX and we'll figure it out together. '' I've called several times since XX/XX/XXXX to get assistance with logging in to make a payment. I have had no success with several representatives. After XX/XX/XXXX, I incurred a late fee. The last time that I called was XX/XX/XXXX and I provided a phone number and email address for them to assist me with online access and the representative told me, "" well you still have to wait 15 days for everything to be updated before you can access your account. '' I informed him that by that time I would have another late fee. He offered to take a payment online but I told him that I won't be able to afford the hidden fees for making a payment over the phone.

Fifth Third Bank has been taking money from me that has not been applied appropriately or at all to my home loan.

However, I have had the same bank since before the approval of my home loan. And, every payment that I have made since making payments online, I can retrieve from my bank. I need help finding a lawyer who can go through every page of my payment history with fifth third bank so that I can payoff my home loan and not deal with this company any longer.

95,"Dear Sir I would like to raise a formal complaint against Citizens ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX ). The bank has acted negligently in not resolving its own internal error by incorrectly applying funds to an un-requested Escrow account ( instead of applying correctly to the principal & interest only account ). The error occurred in XX/XX/XXXX and since that date, despite numerous phone calls and attempts to resolve the error, Citizens have been unable to correct the error and have now issued multiple Loan delinquency notices ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) and in appropriately added late charges to the account. 

Summary : The attached extract of the account activity shows that since the loan inception ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) a monthly principal & interest payment of {$2000.00} has been made. No Escrow account ( for real estate taxes ) was requested or provided as real estate taxes were paid directly. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, Citizens incorrectly initiated an Escrow account and paid taxes on my behalf to the XXXX of XXXX MA, despite there being no taxes owing. 
Citizens then sent a letter ( date XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) stating this and notifying an increase in monthly payment to {$3100.00} ( {$2000.00} P & I plus {$1000.00} for XXXX ). 
I called Citizens customer service and requested they correct this unwanted/unrequested Escrow. They informed me that as the payments had been made to the Town of XXXX ( putting the real estate taxes in credit ), I would have to pay Citizens {$6700.00} to close out the Escrow balance and revert my monthly payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX only of {$2000.00}. 
As you can see from the attached transaction record, I made that additional payment on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and was assured by Citizens XXXX XXXX XXXX id : XXXX ) that this would resolve the mistake. 
However on the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Citizens AGAIN incorrectly established an Escrow account ( with a {$1900.00} balance ) despite there being {$0.00} real estate taxes owing ( in fact that account had been over-paid and had a credit being applied to the next quarters taxes not yet due! ) I again phoned Citizens and was past to multiple departments, eventually being told the ( {$6700.00} additional payment made had been "" Misapplied '' by Citizens ( see attached transaction summary ..line XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). 
After escalation to a customer service Manager ( XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Most recently, commencing XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Citizens are sending weekly loan delinquency notices. I have tried multiple times per day over multiple days to contact XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and left numerous voicemails to contact me to no avail. 

I have also called Citizens customer service on numerous occasions and have been waiting on hold for hours as lines are constantly "" busy with other customers ''. 

Citizens negligence in resolving their mistake and despite my very best efforts ( multiple very long phone calls as Citizens refused to communicate via email, exasperated by hours on hold attempting to get thru to the Customer "" service '' number ) has resulted in : a ) In correct Late charges being applied to the loan account b ) My Credit rating rating being negatively impacted c ) Loss of earnings as the huge amounts of time spent trying to sort Citizens error out d ) Emotional distress and worry on the impact of Delinquency notices"
96,"I understand that Wells Fargo was recently found guilty of committing illegal actions during the timeframe I had my mortgage with them from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX. 

I want to know if I qualify for any of the pay out to consumers. When I was with them, I remember having my escrow constantly changing. And not understanding why is a first time homebuyer. So I didnt ask a lot of questions. 

Please let me know."
97,"I received a letter in XXXX explaining my escrow was going to be short and my monthly payment would be increasing as a result. Then I received a letter saying I was going to have force placed insurance purchased on my behalf because of insufficient coverage. I have been trying to figure out what is going on with so so many phone calls to my mortgage company. Almost every call gets me a different explanation with little to no help to actually resolve the situation. I have been told I was being charged for a force placed flood insurance policy, that I have two different homeowners insurance policies being billed by the same company, that I do not have sufficient coverage, and that the master insurance policy for my hoa can not be applied to my account because of the property type being labeled as a single family home when it is actually a townhouse. I have spent hours and hours on hold, explaining the situation, re explaining the situation, and asking for support to have this addressed so my mortgage payment could be accurate. 

To. No. Avail. I am exhausted. I am angry. My time is being wasted. I am not being respected. 

Everyone on the customer service line politely tells me that after any changes are made I will be reimbursed for overpayment. At this point, I have not been able to correct the first error in the escrow account ( two different policies with the same insurance company being factored into escrow, when only one policy actually exists ) which has already increased my mortgage by almost $ XXXX/month as of XX/XX/2023. Now they are additionally threatening to increase my mortgage even more due to force placed insurance that I do not need. I have little confidence in their ability to accurately address these issues due to my experience thus far."

99,"The dispute is with Citizens Bank on a mortgage. The loan is with me and my son. My son lives at the house for which this mortgage was obtained. 

My son received a statement dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that his escrow account had a shortfall of {$3400.00}, which would raise his payment from {$1100.00} to {$1500.00}, a {$310.00} increase!! I knew something had to be wrong about that, so I reviewed the escrow records. The review showed that there were excessive insurance payments made in XXXX, which will be described below. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, Citizens sent an insurance payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$2000.00} to cover the cost of the annual home insurance ( Citizens check no XXXX ). However, the check arrived after the expiration of the policy, and XXXX XXXX XXXX would not reinstate the policy. The insurance agent notified me of the problem, and a new policy with a new insurance company ( XXXX ) was obtained. In XX/XX/XXXX, Citizens sent a check to XXXX in the amount of {$1900.00} and {$23.00}. They sent another check to XXXX in the amount of {$360.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called my insurance agent to look into this. He told me that XXXX XXXX insurance received the check too late, and that they cancelled the policy and would not reinstate it. He also told me that when he contacted XXXX XXXX, that they said that they did NOT cash Citizen 's check XXXX, and that it was sent back to Citizens Bank to the address on the check ( see attached letter ). I contacted Citizens insurance department to let them know what had happened. They said that they would put a tracer on the check which would take seven days. I contacted the mortgage department ( representative XXXX XXXX to find out what the payment would be once the {$2000.00} was put back into the account. He said that he would have to check with the insurance department to discuss this, but since they were already closed, he would call me back the next day. He did not call me back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the Citizens insurance department again and spoke to a Lateesh ( sp? ). She said that the check was found and that the {$2000.00} would be back in the escrow account the next day, XX/XX/XXXX. I also spoke to XXXX in Citizens mortgage department. She told me that we could spread the shortage over 36 months with a payment of {$1300.00} to lower the required payment until the issue was resolved, but that she would have to submit it for approval. Not knowing what else to do, I told her to submit it. However, she told me that once the {$2000.00} was credited to the account, the new payment would be {$1200.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the normal automatic payment went to Citizens from my sons account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked the Citizens account online and found that the {$2000.00} was still not back in the escrow account, and the payment was still {$1500.00}. I called Citizens insurance line back again. However, apparently, I hit the wrong option on the automated system, and it sent me ( unknowingly ) to customer service, where I waited on hold for about two and a half hours ( there was no option for a call back ). They transferred me to the insurance department, where I spoke with XXXX, who put me on hold for another 30 minutes. I hung up because I had another issue to attend to. I called back again, and I eventually spoke with XXXX, who told me that the research department had found the money ( either found the check or that it was not cashed, I was not clear ). They had to issue a stop payment, which could have been done on XX/XX/XXXX, but that it had not happened yet. There was a note in the file at 9:09 a.m., that it will be put in the account ( presumably from the research department ). I wanted to complain about XXXX putting me on hold for 30 minutes and find out why the money wasn't in the account now, so she put me through to her supervisor, XXXX ( sp? ). XXXX said that there were processes that had to be followed, and that it would take several days to get it done since the stop payment hadn't occurred until this call ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I told her that it should have been done a week earlier. She acknowledged that mistakes had been made and that I should not have been told that the money would be back in on XX/XX/XXXX. I told her that all that I wanted was for the money to be replaced and to pay a normal payment as if the money were in the account. She said she understood, but that there were processes. I also told her that I would be filing a claim of fraud and theft with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau the next day if the funds were not replaced. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked the account again and to pay the balance between what was paid on XX/XX/XXXX and {$1200.00}, which is what XXXX in the mortgage department said it would be if the payment was re-evaluated with the {$2000.00} placed back into escrow. I noticed that the payment was lowered to the {$1300.00} amount for spreading the shortage over 36 months. I also noticed that the payment made on XX/XX/XXXX was put into a "" suspense '' account and not credited to principal or interest. I contacted Citizens XXXX department again and had them put in the record that I was paying the {$1200.00}, and that if there were any late charges, there would be a problem again. I also let him know that I was filing a claim with the CFPB once I hung up. He said he would have XXXX call me back. XXXX did call me back and stated that there were processes that take time. I told her that all that I wanted was for the money to be replaced, and to pay the normal adjusted payment, which I was told was {$1200.00}, and for the money that was placed in the "" suspense '' account to be credited to principal, interest like it should be. She said that I would have to contact the mortgage department. I told her that I was not willing to sit on hold for another two and a half hours, and that I was done. She acknowledged that they get busy later in the morning. I let her know that Citizens had screwed up at least four times, and I don't see any progress in getting my money back into the account. I don't care about their processes, because they are the ones who screwed up four times ( e.g. sending the check late, not issuing a stop payment multiple times ). Neither I nor my son, had any contact with the check, and if there was any dispute, it should have been between XXXX XXXX XXXX and Citizens, since they are the ones who botched this. I also let her know that I was filing a claim."
100,"In XXXX  I was struggling to make my Wells Fargo Mortgage payments. I made extra payments each month to catch up. However, I didn't notice that Wells was putting the extra funds in my unapplied funds section. XXXX day I received a refund check for those funds, which was equivalent to XXXX mortgage payments. I went to my local branch the same day I receive the check to make the XXXX payments. The teller informed she could not accept the check because my home was in foreclosure. The only way she could accept the payment was if I could pay the full $ XXXX in foreclosure fees at that time. 

I had to file XXXX XXXX to stop the foreclosure, and payback the $ XXXX in foreclosure fees. At the time, I contacted a company that would help me pay my mortgage payments. I did not qualify for the program because I didn't meet their requirement, but I completed the interview process accordingly. The strangest thing is that company paid my mortgage for XXXX  months before they contacted me to sign a payment assistant agreement. Since I didn't meet the program qualification, I let it go and then filed XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX. Why didn't Wells Fargo notify me that I was going in foreclosure? I found out when I ran to the bank with my refund check. 
XXXX. Why did Wells accept mortgage payments from an outside party, but I could not make a payment without paying the $ XXXX first. 
XXXX. Why didn't Wells simply take the unapplied funds and apply the XXXX payment to my mortgage, instead of sending a refund check. 

No one ever contacted me from Wells Fargo to inform me that I was going into default! I learned when I went to the bank with the unapplied funds refund."
