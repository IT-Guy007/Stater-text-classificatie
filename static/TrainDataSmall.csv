This is abundantly on top of the hardship experienced and is repeated for me. Cooper requesting a hardship letter already issued in the complaint process Read below of death by COVID ... tenant sick    after dad died. Then on top of that Mr. Cooper causing more hardship with this situation. 


This letter is regarding Mr Cooper mortgage company 's behavior and actions over the phone over the last   years out of Texas        Texas  and wherever their call centers are located that we do not know of. 


When we call we talked to  different people over a period of   months or longer and we never are given the same information. We call in to make a monthly payment and it is a hassle. We talked to a phone tree for  minutes and finally get to speak to a representative to make the payment it always takes too long and the representative is unfriendly to help us process the payment. When calling in or receiving letters we were never given accurate balances per month and we were charged finance charges and late fees and other fees for miscommunication between Mr Cooper and us which never should have taken place because it should be easy to make a payment per month and given a balance. This was held back purposely by the way you train your call centers to charge these fees. This paragraph is about  and   before moving to senior housing living dealing with Mr Cooper from    and how up to this date it has wrecked credit scores for  and  . 


This paragraph is about tenants trying to make payments who are the son of  &   and the  who is       of   whom is  of    . During  and     , who is   of   who is the   of  and   and are the   of     for     of the   at     The situation in all parties trying to make payments and giving permission to make payments we're trying to make payments every month calling in and they were hassled and given permission to make the payments by a letter of declaration that was also a hassle. When   and   tried to call in to make payments the same problem with  minutes of a phone tree to get to a representative and the representative was not helpful to take the payment and whenever the confusion of making these payments there were late fees that were unknown.. there were extra charges unknown added to the loan without communication by Mr Cooper to give a proper balance per month.  a  r died in  of covid and we were offered by Mr Cooper covid relief filling out forms every 3 months. We know that Mr Cooper accepted government money of the covid relief program to disperse. We were given empty promises that this covid relief would either replace the payments or do a forbearance to hold off on monthly payments. Then in  of  and       and   tenant of    had   and the forms were still being filled out every   months. Then in    tenant of    had   again in  and  of  and these forms were still being filled out by  and  . This exasperating process was supposed to at least get forbearance or at the very best pay the payments but then Mr Cooper came back and said none of this worked none of this was going to hold off the payments and we were surprised with {$18000.00} of catching up with the loan and before that in between of filling out the paperwork we were told that we had to make payments and we kept filling out the paperwork in hopes to just start fresh with the {$700.00} per month payment but they before that said oh it's {$3000.00} or {$4000.00} to catch up on. Payment per month. So we kept filling out the paperwork and hopes that this covid relief would take place or forbearance could start us fresh at  $ per month agreement and it never did. 


Now Mr Cooper has done a foreclosure for // and we are going to do whatever we can to do an injunction to stop foreclosure and by law of Missouri do a loan modification and have an agency  and HUD and   help us speak with Mr Cooper. There will be no more phone calls because Mr Cooper can not be trusted over the phone. All communication and information will all be in writing for now on and Mr Cooper must respond by law and by law of Missouri in a loan modification. Missouri law states that no foreclosure can take place in a loan modification. We need the agency of  and HUD and the     to intervene with this process because Mr Cooper can not be trusted over the phone as we've tried this for years. I,  , am living at     so loan modification by    must be accomplished with Mr. Cooper allowing loan modification by   . 


And if necessary after we figure all this out with loan modification and stopping foreclosure and trying to get out from under Mr Cooper and   using his finances to buy the loan out we want to look into suing Mr Cooper for all the harassment, all the lies, all the problems over the phone that have happened for years and they have these recordings but most likely they will loose these recordings that are in their system of all these phone calls. 

Never should it end up this way especially after Mr Cooper received COVID relief from us government..

Next, I want to thank you for your thoroughness and excellent communication skills by keeping me informed throughout this process. Unfortunately, I can not say this for the previous Loan Originator,   ( Please feel free to share this with him and his Supervisors ), which leads me to my complaint : Below is a chronological list of communications of events since I joined NFCU in order to apply for a Mortgage Refi. Cash Out Option : // : Spent over  hours at a local branch waiting to submit documentation to join NFCU.  // : Called in to check on my membership status and was informed that NFCU does not have certain documents that I presented while in person. I had to go back and resubmit those documents again! 

// : Received a WELCOME email from NFCU. 

// : Spoke to   who instructed that I need to pay for a Credit Pull in order for us to move forward. I paid the {$20.00} non-refundable fee. 

// : Received Initial Disclosures email from  .??? 

// : Received email stating NFCU received my Application. 

// : -Received Initial Disclosures email from     . 
-After reading, I called   inform him that I am a 100 %  Veteran and that I am not to pay the {$5400.00} Funding Fee that is included in the Loan Estimate. He stated that this was only an Estimate and my acknowledgement is only for receiving it. ( He also informed me that my nterest Rate was locked in for 60 days at 2.875 % ) -I asked him about how to submit my Award Letters and he stated, "" There will be a time to do that later. '' // : -I received an email asking me to take a  minute survey, but there was no option to respond to the survey. 
-Received Outstanding Items email from   well as a call indicating he was having issues getting my credit reports. He further stated that it will take 3-5 days to pull them once they are unfrozen. { I had issues with , but by //, I had contacted all three Credit Bureaus to unfreeze my credit reports through //. } // : Sent email to  asking where to upload my  Letters and asked about rate drop ( 2.5 % ) ...?

He later emailed me at  to indicate, ""  is not reporting. '' I contacted all  Credit Bureaus again and it was confirmed AGAIN that all  Bureaus were still unfrozen through //.

He said something to the effect that he would do his best. I explained to him that I would be very upset if I lost it! I immediately called and reapplied over the phone with   as he instructed.

If my experience from the inception of becoming a NFCU member will continue in this dubious manner, I am considering cancelling my membership! 

I HIGHLY suggest that NFCU conducts an Audit of the Rhode Island Office due to the Loan Officer 's inability to conduct due diligence ; provide timely communications ; reconsider documentation submission priority, as well as the number of applications a Loan Officer can handle for its Members.  seemed overwhelmed throughout the process, even working from home. Oftentimes, he seemed like he didn't know who I was when I would call him. He would state, I'm not at my desk, so I will call you when I get back home. Granted, one time he was sent to the office to pick up the ( Company 's ) mail. ( Who knows, maybe I just kept catching him on his lunch breaks...?! ) Honestly, the interest rate actually dropped to 2.5 % after I locked in- I should be demanding that rate. NFCU Mortgage Loan Originators / Application Decision Makers appear to be partial. I demand that the dropdown to 2.5 % interest rate be honored and that we may proceed with the Refinance in a competent and equitable manner. I am prepared to pay the Appraisal Fee upon If neither the 2.5 % nor the 2.8 % rates will NOT be honored, I will be forced to submit governmental complaints due to inadequate or ineffectual fair lending compliance. However, I do hope that we can resolve this amicably, as I am prepared to pay the Appraisal Fee. 

I look forward to hearing the good news! 

Thank you, .  AM (  hours ago ) to  Thank you . 

I forgot to include a very important detail in my complaint. Please add the following information : // :  stated that for VA  they need all three Credit Bureau reports. 

// : In my phone conversation with , he stated that once he saw my scores he submitted the 2 Credit Bureau reports that he had (  and  ). He further stated that unfortunately for VA loans they need all three. 

My question to him was why would you submit my file with 2 Bureau reports when you need all three ...? He responded by stating that he was under a timeline. 

If that was the case, he should have contacted and communicated that information with me before I had to call him to question the email I received earlier that day ( // ) regarding a Denial Package Reminder. 

Please fwd. 

Thank you. 

Today ( // )  called me to confirm that she forwarded my complaint to her Supervisor responsible for escalations (   ) and Manager, and that I should expect a call today from  today. I received a call from  at  who informed me that he submitted my complaint to the "" Pricing Desk '' who controls interest rates ; and they rejected my request to change my interest rate. He further stated that he will forward my complaint to the previous Loan Officer 's Manager at least for a coaching opportunity. He confirmed that you can actually change ( lower ) your rate 2 times once you lock in a rate - this changed last year. He also confirmed that he is  's Direct Boss and that   is the Branch Manager. He offered me an opportunity to pay a 1 % Origination Fee ( {$1500.00} ) to get my initial locked in rate ( 2.875 % ), but that it would come out of the   that I will receive. 

I informed him of my understanding that they have a way of verifying rates and that I will submit a complaint to every governmental agency responsible for NFCU 's lack of providing and conducting due diligence. 

Background Information : The previous Loan Officer,  , failed to communicate or conduct due diligence in a timely manner. He instructed me to reapply, but my application was reassigned. I'm sure he knew this was going to occur, but lead me to believe he would be able to do a Tri-Merger and proceed with the loan. Also, when I texted him the new Application number, he never responded. However, the following week he confirmed when  called him, that I had already paid the Credit Pull fee. I feel that I received Disparate and Unfair Treatment for several reasons : 1. I did not provide them my race.

2. Due to the Previous Loan Officers failure to meet tasks and misleading me throughout the Application process.

3. The Statement of Denial checked the box, NFCU does not grant credit on the terms requested. It further states on the back, If you have any questions regarding this notice, you should contact : (  )  when you call that number it asks you for a  code, which was not provided, and that is the only option on the call.

So I emailed the branch manager about this, and he emailed me that because my student loans were in forbearance, they would have to use the 1 % rule. That is not correct. All my student loans are IBR and are in forbearance due to the Cares Act and the fact that I re-enrolled in school to complete my   dissertation and receive my diploma.

I applied for a new loan with   in  to pay off this loan after reading the reviews of SLS. I was to sign the papers for this loan today ( // ). However, I received a phone call from an officer at    facilitating my loan today in which he stated SLS had filed an additional complaint to the credit reporting agencies, today, saying I was 120 days delinquent. I didn't find out until     had sold my loan when I went in and spoke to an officer and was informed by him that that was what happened. I was told by him they had mailed a notification of this to the address I lived at when I took out the loan. I haven't lived there for 12 years and they have all my current address and telephone information because I still bank with them. So is    's incompetence my fault? 

I didn't make payments from  to  because I had no idea where to make a payment. Yes, I should have gone to    when that loan disappeared from my accounts. My bad. However, SLS during that time period made no attempt to contact me and they can't say they couldn't get my current address and phone number from   . There are no other companies - mobile phone, power, water, etc ... that wouldn't notify you if you were past due on a bill after a month. This was done deliberately by them, of this I have no doubt, in the hopes they would be able to foreclose on my house.

My payments are {$460.00} per month. By telling me that's what my payment was they committed fraud. A lawyer told me they can't increase my payments and I pay my taxes and insurance myself.

54,2017-11-17,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,"My problem actually begun back in  after my spouse  on   . Immediately I began to get letters from mt them mortgage collector  about foreclosing on my property. My property address       TN, . At that time I was married, My spouse is  now. WE had purchased this home and moved in on   . The cost was {$120000.00} with an interest rate of 8.85 %. We accepted this because we could not get a better deal at the time due to both our credit. And my spouse had his own business and was doing quite well at that time. 

In  I had a company try to help me get the loan modified but the  people would not return the calls from the company called       (  ). The only thing they were able to do was to help get my spouses name removed from the deed and the city and county tax records, in case at a later date I was able to get  to work with me.. Though they continued to send me letters threatening to foreclose, I made my mortgage payments and tried to find a way out. The way out was to refinabnce the property and get out from under . I was unable to get the property refinanced because I had a bankruptcy from . And because of the value of the property versus what was still owed on it. 

So I had an independent appraisal done and discovered the property was only worth {$72000.00} and I still owed {$100000.00}, and I had recommendations to try to get the company to do a loan modifcation,  said no. Said the original owner would not agree. So short sale or deed in lieu, pay it off. I could not pay it off. So the collection attempts continued. 


Anyway before they passed my contract to my current collectors  (    ) in  . I had them to send me a copy of all my payment records, I had only been late once in the 20 years. Which is why I could not understand them trying to foreclose and take my home I was not behind or ever late. But I finally agreed to a Deed in Lieu, and then everything changed when  took over. 

I had already purchased a new home by the time they told me in   that they would not agree to a deed in lieu. I tried to have the realtor who sold me my current home to do a short sale on the property, but my realtor got back to me and said  would not work with them. They asked what should they do. I said nothing I could do. 

Eventually they said we could try to do a deed in lieu. I was bombarded with forms with the same forms to fill out and to send to them. At first their main sticking point was my spouses estate. My spouse had no other heir but me, so his name was removed from the the property. But  insisted on 'paperwork '. Finally after many attempts to get them to accept his  certificate ( They had asked that when I send it in to them the third and fourth times to make sure I put the account number was on the certiciate,. But when I asked specifcally what was wrong with the certificate, why they were not accepting it. I was told by writing on it that made it a voided document ). I sent 7 copies to  of my husbands death cetificate to them and I was only told on    that the issue of the  certicate was resolved. 

Yet we proceeded on with the deed in lieu, And at one time after several people showed interest in buying the property I contacted  gave them the names and information they requested on 2 separate realtors, but no one was ever allowed to work with  toward a short sale. Then back to the deed in lieu because you can not have someone try to short sale if you are working a deed in lieu. So we tried to do a deed in lieu again and I was bombarded with forms to fill out. However when I sent in the forms the main sticking point was my spouses estate. For months I tried to get a lawyer but just could not afford one to get me in court to get the estate probated. Fimnally I was advised to call the court and explain my situation the fact that I could not afford a lawyer and ask if I could get in court. But probate court clerk said the process had been completed, there was nothing else to be done and there would not be a court date. The  people told me at one time they had spoken to my souse and that 's how the knew I was a fraud. Thats why after I finish speaking to them some of the people there do n't want to speak to me again. Anyway the process that had been done is sometimes done when there is only one heir. They told me where I could find information about the type of procedure that had been done on line and give it to . I found the information and sent it to them but since they never acknowledge exactly what they responded too when I 've sent them information. And they never said anything else about it I did not know til now that the issue is resolved. I only found out because they keep calling me sometimes twice a day, they send me uninformative letters sometimes 3 a week. But after contacting the better business bureau the Onbudsman from  did contact me and said at least the issue of my spouse is resolved. But all the forms that I have sent by mail, FA email and on their site has a shelf life and may have to be done over, I explained that my tax returns form  will not change no mater how long they keep them. And I have filled out so many Form 4506 T, & TEZ for my tax info from the IRS, I can not believe they will send them again. Likewise my income information, All my income is from the Gov., Military Retirement, Military , Civil Service Retirement and Social Security. I have sent them the printed information directly from these agencies and they will not change in a year. This too is harassment. Whatever info on Home Affordable, or HUD forms will not change. The reason I am at this point in my life will not change. I still do n't have anyone who is obligated to help me pay my bills, I am still    and not self employed The only thing that will change is my bank information. If they ask for a copy of a statement on the first I might have {$8000.00}, but on the second or third not so much because I have to pay my bills. So there might be {$1000.00}, but I am not interested in putting one red cent into that property. But effective    I will send them a copy of everything I have signed inlast 60 days every tax form, bank statement and copis of the 10 pages of info I sent on line. Have it copied and ready to drop in the mail as soon as post office opens. By regular mail I caanot afford certified mail just to have them tell me ythe initial on the form does n't belong to anyone who works there. 

Recently (    ) while working on refinancing my new home  was contacted about the amount owed on my property that they are managing,  had my mortgage Co. get me on the phone before they would give them the information. That was fine except while the mortgage company was clearly still on the phone  rep told me that my property was in foreclosure and the date of foreclosure was being sent to me as we spoke. When I asked what about the new deed in lieu we were working on? That I just completed the paperwork online the night before. since the paperwork from   was decided they could not do the deed in lieu. He said 'oh yes I see we have an application ''. So my new mortgage company representative asked that person point blank "" Sir do you have an application on file for the deed in lieu and is that package complete ''. The  representative said 'let me verify ' then came back and said 'yes we have everything we need '. On   I was asked for another hardship letter, a new Request for Assistance form. Thats the last letter I have received but the phone calls keep coming always some scare tactics or just hangup when I answer. 

I am not the first last or only person they have done similar things too. I t seems whenever a loved one passes thats when the problems start. This company should be stopped from the way they are handling cases. I know each case is different but I like every peson they are swindling know their case is individual. They can not or should not be allowed to handle ever case by thhe same standards. I am only concerned about this one my case. Before I moved I was never late or missed a payment with this mortgage from   . I bought another house and can not afford two homes and have no desire to manage a rental property. I have too much invested in that property and do n't want it ruined by a renter. 

I have paid my own insurance and taxes on this property and still pay them now for 22 years and I still owe {$100000.00} I personally paid for a private appraisal before I decided to vacate my property and discovered it 's only worth {$72000.00}, that 's when despite of a {$12000.00} bathroom for  I had put in in  , brand new stove dishwasher and Refrig I put in in  . New Hard wood floors in , security system furnace and Air conditioner. I decided I had to move on. I have been trying to unburden myself with this property actually since my spouse  that 's when they first started to talking about taking my home. Now all I want to do is give it to them and they are harassing me and delaying and checking my credit reports and making sure my credit is ruined and still have not done a thing to move forward.

Yet I can not get a simple, request for verification/proof of insurance. Instead they added insurance coverage and deducted the amount out of payments to Seterus causing a deficit. Imagine my surprise as I spoke with Seterus ' representative. After several days of conversation between Seterus,  and my self, Seterus claimed they had removed the forced placed insurance and sent a check to  ten business days ago. They claimed they refunded my account for insurance payments from the forced placed insurance. When I ask for proof, they "" do not have to provide it to me as I 'm in an active chpt . '' By the way,  has yet to received said payment. Another issue I have with Seterus is I 've been working to refinance my home thru HARP and they have done everything from sending out payoff that expires within  hrs to refusal to provide 30 day payoff, to not giving a payoff that 's long enough for us to close on our loan. They state "" it is against our policy '' to provide what seems to be an industry standard. Escalating in this company is pointless. Everything takes 7-10 business days to get, even if the error was on their part. They continue the same error over and over again and yet bill us each time. It takes them 7-10 business days to process your payment once they received it. Industry standards take 24-48 hrs for any of these type of requests. They never acknowledge anything in writing upon requesting information from them. This company is doing what they want to and always quoting it 's their legal right.

68,2020-12-19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,"The mortgage refinance process was probably the worst service experience I have ever had from application to close. I was mislead throughout the process. This is a timeline of events : 1. My first appointment was a disaster - it took over 90 minutes because   ( ""  '' ) didnt know how to do the mortgage application and ended up making me do it TWICE. She told me sob stories about how other customers have yelled at her and I felt sorry for her so I didnt want to complain. 
2. The application paperwork was generated and sent to me via email on //2020 NOT securely these documents contained my FULL Social Security Number among other confidential information. This is a HUGE security risk. 
3. On //2020 I went to the branch to sign the application paperwork and to provide my payment for the Credit Report and Appraisal ( a total of {$500.00} ). I wrote two checks, one for each service. Branch Manager   ( ""  '' ) personally answered a few questions I had on the Loan Estimate document because  was incapable of providing an explanation. The numbers did not make sense to me. There were charges that were not applicable which you explained and I was assured by  many times it was just an estimate and "" it comes off at the end ''. 
4. After about 1 1/2 weeks, I noticed my checks were still not yet cashed. I followed up via phone call because I had not heard from anyone and was concerned there was a problem with said checks. I was called by  and asked to provide new checks because there was a mistake made when depositing the checks and they couldnt be deposited. When I asked what kind of mistake could have possibly caused this,  blamed it on her   and that she couldnt see what she was doing. 
5. On //2020 I requested via phone call and email ( attached ) that the original checks be returned me when I drop off the new checks. It was confirmed in writing the checks would be returned. My mom dropped off the checks without the original checks being returned to me. To date, those checks were NEVER returned to me nor were copies provided to me that showed a deposit attempt. Makes me wonder if those checks were lost/misplaced by someone at Peoples? 
6. Then on //,  personally called me to explain that an internal deadline was not met (  also noted it was 100 % the fault of Peoples Bank ) and an entire new loan application had to be generated and I would need to resign all of the documents. He said this would create a difference in the rate but Peoples Bank would cover the difference. This was very inconvenient and had me doubt the capability of Peoples Bank to handle this process but I was assured everything would be fine going forward as I would not be charged any more than originally quoted. 
7. Weeks went by without hearing a word from anyone at People 's. I went to the branch one Saturday but both  and  were off. When I called  on //2020 she blamed the delay on the mortgage underwriters. 
8. On //2020 I received the Commitment Letter via email which had my address spelled incorrectly. I asked to have it corrected and it was. I also asked why the appraised value of my home was not updated to the official appraised value of {$590000.00} ( email attached ). I was required to pay {$490.00} for an appraisal so the Appraisal Value should be reflected on these loan documents.  assured me the appraisal value would be reflected properly on the Closing Disclosure. 
9. I did not hear from   or anyone for a couple weeks and was worried my loan was lost again. On //, I needed to provide more information which I did so in a timely manner. 
10. I followed up with  on //2020 worried that the closing date would be missed. I was told everything was being sent to the attorney. When she confirmed the documents were sent to the attorney on // she again blamed the delay on the underwriters working from home since //. She assured me that the attorneys office would go over the Closing Disclosure and explain everything to me. I was also concerned that I was being charged too much by the attorney. I had no previous relationship with the attorney. On Day 1 I was told to pick an attorney from a long list the bank used and was told that there would be no additional fee or charge, they all charge the same amount and only charge the bank. Clearly looking at the fees on the Closing Disclosure, misleading and incorrect information was given to me. 
12. On Monday, //, the day of the closing, I had an unaffiliated third-party assist me in reviewing the Closing Document because I did not know why the closing costs were so high, why Section E did not add up, why the appraised value was not reflected and what Lender Credits were. I was surprised to hear that Line Item A. 3 Loan Level Price Adjustment to Peoples United Bank looked to be points as I was under the assumption from Day 1 that there were ZERO points involved in this mortgage. I thought maybe that was the rate difference that Peoples was covering but then the Lender Credits did not completely offset that amount so it did not make sense to me.

13. By early afternoon, I was very concerned about the Closing Disclosure being incorrect and misleading and I decided not to proceed with the closing.

14. Shortly after I stated I would not be moving forward, I received a call from  to discuss the experience and to see if there was anything he could clarify and anything he could do to make me reconsider. After speaking to me twice he clarified that Line Item A. 3 was the difference in rate caused by the mistake that was made by Peoples Bank causing me to complete another application LUMPED TOGETHER with a 1/4 point for not escrowing my property taxes. I was never told ( and dont recalling seeing anywhere in writing ) that I would incur points for not escrowing my property taxes. And why was this lumped together as if to hide it?  told me it was a preference to either pay property taxes/homeowners insurance out of pocket or via escrow. If I knew up front that points were charged for not escrowing the property taxes, then I would have escrowed the property taxes. 
15.  then emailed me on // at  ( attached ) to provide some "" clarifications ''.  included an updated Closing Disclosure which the Appraised Property Value on Page 1 is still the estimated value provided on Day 1, not the appraised value that I paid {$490.00} for. How is it that I was required to pay Peoples Bank {$490.00} ( I asked why the home needed to be appraised in the first place give the amount of equity and I was told I HAD to have it appraised ) to have an person come inside my home during a pandemic to appraise my home and then Peoples Bank never even acknowledged this appraised value on any of my loan documents? Additionally, Section E did still not add up. I also do not see in anywhere in writing that points are charged for not escrowing taxes and it was definitely NOT broken out on the document.

I had every intent to proceed with this loan to get a better rate than I have on my HELOC at People 's Bank and to fund a home improvement project. I provided all required documentation, paperwork and payment in timely manner. However, after all of the experiences listed above, including the misleading and inaccurate Closing Disclosure, I did not feel comfortable closing on this loan. I even thought I was not provided the best rate at the time and it should have been 2.875 %. It is unfortunate that the Closing Disclosure was misleading and inaccurate and my concerns went unaddressed until I notified the parties involved that I would no longer be proceeding with the loan. And then even after that, it still was not never rectified to complete accuracy. And to this day, I still never got a full explanation of what happened with the original checks I provided for the Appraisal and Credit Report Fee and my appraised home value was never used.

The lack of knowledge, training, customer service, transparency and oversight at Peoples Bank is appalling.

I sent an email to the branch manager expressing each of these concerns and resolutions on //2020. I followed up to confirm receipt on //2020 and was told I would hear from the People 's complaint department via phone or email in 1-2 weeks.

It has become a great concern of mine with how I am being handled and ignored by the alleged debt collector, Carrington Mortgage Services. They refuse to abide by federal consumer laws. They blatantly ignore the laws presented to them as if they are beyond the laws. The Fair Debt Collection Protection Act was created by Congress to protect consumers from abusive debt collection practices. Carrington Mortgage Services have invaded my privacy on many occasions. They have ignored the Debt validation letter I sent them on //. They are still sending me communications via the mails. I sent an Affidavit on  , 2021. It was received on  , 2021.

I think they will go to great lengths to hide their fraud, not to mention Its a delay tactic. 

Carrington Mortgage Services continue to ignore the federal laws as it pertains to debt, I received ( 6 ) envelopes on the same day with "" A notice to Occupant of Pending Acquisition ''. That is blatant harassment and abusing the debt collection practices. They are nothing more than the servicing agent and have no authority to foreclose. This loan was sold several times and it was also placed in  which means the alleged loan was converted to a stock along with being bundled up with thousands of other loans. It is a huge deception to receive payment from the homeowner, and the loan was satisfied 30 days after the closing. Again, it is no longer a loan but it has been converted to a stock. 

I have repeatedly asked for the name and address of the original creditor. They refuse to provide this information. This information will solve the issue.

I was advised that I should continue paying my normal monthly payment which does not include taxes. In order to make this payment I had to do it over the phone with newrez as I would be paying a lower amount than the statement which incorrectly was including my taxes.

I was given a pin # and then told that I had to enter the pin # within 15 minutes. I did that and the system still did not allow me to create an online account. 

Again on //2021, I contacted PNC Bank and the representative tells me that they will have to "" mail '' me a pin # in order for me to create an account, but they are "" able '' to take a payment from me over the phone in the meantime. 

I explained my concern for providing my banking information without having an established online account. The rep then tells me, "" if you don't make a payment by the end of the month, then I will be penalized for the late payment ''. 

In my opinion, PNC Bank has established a business model that will guarantee penalty payments for new customers. The antiquated process ensures no one will be able to set up an online account in time to make online payments ( without a penalty ). For example, if their existing system is unable to recognize my account information to establish an online account, then why should I have confidence that my payment "" over the phone '' will be applied to the correct account that doesn't exist. 

This business practice needs to be investigated and PNC Bank needs be held accountable for establishing antiquated systems that provide barriers to consumers attempting to make mortgage payments on time ( without penalty ).

2. Why is my statement ALWAYS wrong after I pay the escrow shortage?
3. Why was I told last summer that the problem had been fixed and I would receive a CORRECT statement after I paid the escrow shortage? Why was I lied to AGAIN??
4. What is going to be done in the future to prevent this from happening again? 
5. Why is my escrow short every year?? This is not a problem I 've had with other mortgage companies.
6. Why was I blocked from posting on  even though I did NOT use any profanity as suntrust claims?? I simply told the TRUTH about being LIED to. 
7. Why does customer service at suntrust ?? I should not have to file complaints with  different agencies to get customer service and even then I still have not gotten the information I 've repeatedly requested. 
The  at suntrust are still trying to charge me a late fee for my payment in . Thats !!!! They sent me wrong statements for 2 MONTHS and when I tried to make a payment online ON THE DUE DATE, the website would NOT let me make an additional principal payment. I sent an email through the website asking why I couldnt make an additional principal payment ( as Ive done every month for 4 years ) and while the auto response said I would get a response within 2 business days, its been over 5 MONTHS and Ive NEVER gotten a response.

234,2021-08-27,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"In  of 2020 I called my loan servicer, Mr. Cooper ( actual name of the company ), and was immediately granted Pandemic Forebearance. On //2020 I called with several questions re how the Forbearance would work. I was told by the Mr. Cooper agent that the Forbearance covered  thru  at that point and my not being current did not matter, I was now "" protected. '' I was only past due for the  and  payments at that time and concerned about being able to pay before the last day in  to avoid being 90 days delinquent. Again the agent told me not to worry, that Mr. Cooper "" wanted to help during these trying times. '' Throughout my 16 month Forbearance I stayed in contact with Mr. Cooper to plan for what came after my Forbearance ended. For several months I was assured by agents I would be offered a Deferment. On almost every single call, I was given conflicting information from the call before. Transferred to many extensions with those agents confused as to why I had been transferred to them. Many times disconnected after waiting on hold up to one hour or more. Never once was my Single Point of Contact, as listed on mailed correspondence, available to speak with me. 
I've kept very detailed notes with names and dates if these are needed later. 
Although my mortgage is not Federally backed, from the time I was granted Forbearance up until this past // when my Forbearance ended, I was told that Mr. Cooper is "" following the guidelines of the CARES ACT. '' Unfortunately, their following those guidelines ended when my Forbearance ended. I was not only denied a Modification because I was not current on my loan at the onset of Forbearance and because my equity is not low enough, but also denied the Deferment because of not being current. My lender is only offering a Short Sale or a Deed in Lieu. My lender would rather Foreclose on my home of 25 years than to extend Deferment because of 2 past due payments. This is especially hurtful since I had been assured since the beginning by several Mr. Cooper agents that my being behind did not matter. If I had been given accurate information in  of 2020, I would have delayed asking for Forbearance until I could borrow money from family to get current. 
I have sent letters, emails, and Messages through my Mr. Cooper online account asking for help to avoid Foreclosure. I've made suggestions such as my paying a lump sum of the two months I was delinquent in order to be considered for Deferrment. I've asked for a Balloon Payment to be added at the end of my loan. No help is forthcoming. 
Yesterday received an email response to my latest plea for help. It was from a loan executive at Mr. Cooper and again contained misinformation. Most distressing is that in regards to my informing them that on //2020 their agent ( I stated the name, his location and exact words ) told me my not being current did not matter and that the Forbearance covered  thru , the loan executive told me that could not be verified because the phone recordings had been "" purged ''. I responded today by email letting him know I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB. I also included a lengthy account of all the misinformation I'd received from Mr. Cooper and again asked that they contact my lender on my behalf and ask them to work with me to keep my home. 
I am a  year old woman on   . This has been my only home for 25 years. I am extremely stressed and can not eat or sleep much over the thought of losing my home. I am only asking for help and what is fair. Why would anyone Foreclose on a home when someone was not in Foreclosure at the time Forbearance help was offered? 
I have contacted CalHFA and am hoping to be eligible for their HAF program when the Treasury approves the plan they have submitted. Mr. Cooper has informed me that I will start to receive Foreclosure notices after //. I truly hope my lender reconsiders and broadens their guidelines to include everyone who received Forebearance. I wish my loan was Federally backed so I would not have to be going thru this.

In -I 'm finally conditionally approved but there is still no movement. At this time life is happening, new job prospects, the home needs repairs but I can't do anything because my re-finance has not moved and you are told not to run your credit or change jobs. My life is being majorly impacted by this process and Mr. Coopers lacking ability to do their job. I make several customer service complaints with little explanations as to why nothing is happening except "" this is how it is.

I get the quotes, turn them in, and they magically meet the other lenders ( which was way less in closing costs ) and have a closing date. The only reason I decided to go with Mr. Cooper after all the trouble is because I literally HAD to have the loan close so I could move on in my personal life with things I needed to do. 
 -I am told by   that I will be received {$1400.00} at closing ( electronically if I choose and I will give a voided check to the notary that comes to our home ) and then I will received a separate check for around {$1000.00} in the snail mail 2 weeks after closing. I receive my funds from closing in the amount of {$1800.00} and I made another mortgage payment so I assume yea that's why I got a little back. 
 signed closing documents at our home   It's been 3 weeks since closing and I don't have my {$1000.00} escrow refund check yet but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and wait until next Monday.

I also finally get through to someone at customer service and the first person I speak with tells me that there is no disbursements and my escrow money was rolled over to my new escrow account.

As of //, NewRez has not paid the property tax that was due, instead holding my money that I had already paid them in escrow. 

2. I sent a written notice of error to NewRez on //. No acknowledgment of receipt of this notice of error has bene forthcoming as of // ( 9 business days later ). I called on // and alerted them to the error and sent a copy of the property tax bill to the helpfful lady who answered my call. The best she could do was to promise me to "" Open a research inquiry and respond within 15 business days '', no fault of hers but a bit ridiculous since they actually had a copy of the tax bill showing that the amount was due on  and they had not paid it. 

3. The underwriting process is broken - they never provide a comprehensive checklist of documents that the client has to provide. Instead they ask for docs, a few weeks later ask to clarify certain things like a transfer to a bank account, then wait more weeks and ask for updated docs  pay stubs and bank statements in particular ), rinse and repeat. I must have submitted paystubs and bank statements 7-8 times over 6 months. The final irony was when they wrote back to say my loan amount was inaccurate because I was getting too much cash back solely because they had dragged the process out for so long that I had paid my loan principal down so much. The most important consequences of this delay were i ) the need to re-run my credit ( a second hard inquiry that dinged my credit score ) ; ii ) the need to re-cert my appraisal ( although they did credit me for that fee ) and iii ) the fact that my new mortgage payment was {$600.00} less than the old one, so I paid {$3600.00} extra over the dragged out refinance of which I assume at least half was due to unnecessary foot-dragging.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Shellpoint Partners, LLC",MA,02482,,True,Web,2021-05-17,Closed with explanation,True,True,4382332,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['tax', 'business', 'dragged']"

274,2019-08-24,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"During the 2nd week of //, I received my annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement. Since this is the first year with Loancare as my mortgage servicer, this is the first time they have provided me this letter.

On the Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement, it was noted that I had an escrow surplus of {$150.00}. In other words, I had paid more into escrow than was necessary. As such, Loancare issued me a check for {$150.00}.

Also on the Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement, my semiannual property ( county ) tax disbursements were listed. I own two parcels. For one of the parcels, the semiannual property tax disbursement transferred identically from // to //, which is accurate. For the second parcel, a rear, half acre parcel on which there is no structure, no improvement, no change, Loancare noted that my semiannual tax disbursement would increase from {$67.00} to {$1300.00}. This equates to a difference of {$2600.00} for the year! As a result, my monthly escrow payment increased from {$590.00} to {$770.00}. This is almost {$200.00} more per month.

When I noticed this issue in early //, I began calling Loancare. At the time, they said that this issue would be fixed by //. It is now // and I have had to make two mortgage payments that are almost {$200.00} more per month than I had planned. I did not budget for this.

To date, I have called Loancare 7 times. I have sent them 3 emails via their customer service contact email address. I have received no response to any of the emails - either by phone, email, or mail. During those calls and within those emails, I have discussed the Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement, I have provided a link to my county auditor 's page for the parcel in question, I have provided the phone number to my county auditor, and I have explained the situation clearly and thoroughly. I don't know what more I could do - I've basically done their job for them, and yet they have taken no action on their end.

Today, I was told that this process may take another month or more. Simply put, I don't have the money to continue to make monthly payments that are {$200.00} more than they are supposed to be.

I don't know if Loancare is simply negligent ( i.e., they don't care about their customers at all ) or fraudulent ( they hike escrow payments in the hopes that borrowers default on their mortgages ), but something is amiss. This is the 6th property I've owned, and I have NEVER experienced a single issue with a mortgage servicer until now.

Please investigate Loancare.

On //2022, Flagstar declined my application because of the "" late '' payment. They wasted my time for 2 months, when they had this information in their file the entire time.

I called to discuss my options on refinancing the home. After a discussion on loan balance on my primary and secondary and home value, it was told to me that I did not qualify to refinance. I then asked what my options were if the loan matured and what would happen. The representative said she could not help as she only handled refinances and would need to transfer me to Customer Service. I spoke to the Customer Service representative and she then said she could not handle and would need to transfer me to a loa n specialist. After reviewing my situation with the specialist she could not help me and said that my only option was to speak to the loan modification specialist. I then spoke to the loan modification specialist and she explained that i  would need t o apply for the loan modification and depending on my case it may or may not be approved. She advised me to wait until my loan matures which is 1 year away. I told her I did not  want to wait as I wanted to work with the bank to get this resolved now and discuss my options. I could not qualify for the refinance because my house would not appraise at the value to meet a 90 % loan to value threshold. She indicated that the loan modification application would be mailed to me. She said it would take    days to bet processed but did warn me that if I accepted the modification that it would impact m y credit score.      What surprises me is that I have been a customer for 20 years wit h US Bank and h ave been in good standings throughout that timeframe. I am calling to try to work with the bank to arrange a solution and they have nothing to offer. She indicated that when it matures I would go in to collections for the full amount which in turn would impact my credit. I asked that she check with a superior as I clearly did not fall in to the normal criteria for modifications and not sure I need a modification but it appears no one I spoke to had any solutions or support.      US Bank has a long standing customer with excellent credit ( 800+ score ) and they have no other solution than to tell me to wait and/or apply for a modification ( which most likely I would not qualify for ). In the meantime I will submit for the modification to see what the formal outcome is but it seems inappropriate that a good customer would have to negatively impact their credit score. I am proactively trying to resolve my situation and it appears that the bank is giving me no options.

Last week I discovered that Chase failed to pay my home owners insurance annual premium, FROM THE ESCROW ACCOUNT THAT IS AT ISSUE IN MY PRIOR COMPLAINT, when I got a text from my insurance company telling me that my policy would lapse at  that night if not paid. 

When I called Chase, I was asked to confirm that  was my current carrier. I advised them that there had been no change and was puzzled as to why it was not PAID if they KNEW who the insurance carrier was. I was not given any type of answer. I was however advised that it was likely not paid because the insurance company had the WRONG ADDRESS. When in fact, Chase had the wrong address. Chase has the mailing and property address FOR THE PROPERTY THAT IT IS THE MORTGAGE HOLDER ON. Chase has    ,   NEVADA . When in fact the property address is    , , NV . How is this? I was then advised that this was likely "" the address that was on the original loan documents. '' I advised that was incorrect. My prior mortgage holder had the correct address on file and the documents would never have recorded correctly to transfer ownership. I was then transferred at least 4 times wherein the representatives could not understand that Chase has the wrong address. I was asked to send in tax documentation to confirm the property address and the parcel ID #. I refused - it is not my problem. I have attached a PDF print out of the  County Assessors office supporting my assertion that Chase has no idea what they are doing. 

This has got me believing that Chase likely does not have a correct or accurate copy of my loan documents. I mean, if they did, they would know the correct property address, right? 

Lastly, I continue to get calls in response to my prior CFPB complaint which seem to miss the point. My concern is not regarding the payment of my special district taxes - DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT NOT PART OF MY ORIGINAL LOAN AGREEMENT. My problem is that Chase is apparently unwilling to allow me to make a deposit into my escrow account ( WHICH IS VOLUNTARY AND MY MONEY TO BEGIN WITH ) and the reassess or re-evaluate my escrow account as to any "" projected shortage '' that may occur over the next year ... so that once that is done, my monthly payment will not increase. Chase apparently does not care what is in my original loan documents, what would be a "" Courtesy '' for its customers ( I have never asked for a courtesy revaluation of my escrow account with Chase and I believe that I am entitled to ask for that, in writing, in the event that I do not agree with the projection. ) This is not rocket science, but common courtesy.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NV,89044,,True,Web,2018-10-09,Closed with explanation,True,True,3041268,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['chase', 'address', 'courtesy']"

In //, our mother passed away and it became an extreme hardship for my brother and I. As of //, we had made payments in excess of {$750000.00}. We understand that most of that was interest because of how the loan is amortized. We went to Ocwen Loan Servicing and told them we wanted to do everything we could to keep our family investment as it was the right thing to do and we had so much already invested. We were told to file for a loan modification. We filled out all the paperwork right away and it took over a year for them to receive everything they needed. They kept telling us they didn't receive documents even though we sent the documents certified mail. They would tell us one page was missing which was not the case because we scanned everything into one PDF and also emailed the files so if they received one page they received all the pages. The house at the time of loan modification application was appraised by a realtor ( comp basis ) of {$720000.00} but our balance was ~ {$840000.00}. They would not accept payments during the application process but they added late fees and penalties every month. Now they tell us we owe over {$960000.00} after paying for 10 years on an original note of {$990000.00} we only get credit for {$25000.00}. We purchased the house for {>= $1,000,000} so we had a $ {$330000.00} home equity line of credit on my parents primary residence which we had to sell at the time of my mother 's passing in order to pay off this debt. My brother and I now owe this to our remaining  siblings in order to buy them out of my parents share. The original monthly mortgage amount that was paid for 10 years was {$6200.00} without escrow. We paid our property taxes and insurance on our own. We made all these payments on time until both of our parents passed away. After 14 months from the date of application for the loan modification Ocwen Loan Servicing gave us a trial 3 month payment plan. We asked for the terms and they refused to give them to us. They said you make these payments and then we will calculate your final modification. We made the 3 payments of {$6300.00} and then received the final modification to sign. They reduced the interest rate from 6.5 % to 4.125 % and left the maturity date the same. They started the loan over so we lost the benefit of having already paid the first 10 years of an amortized loan which is when the most interest is paid. They also added a balloon payment in the amount of {$430000.00} at the end of the 18.5 years. We were not aware of the balloon payment until after we made all our trial payments. I had to argue with them because the first payment for the trial payment was applied to the previous balance and not to the trial plan payments. We had over 50 calls during this process and it was never clear about what they were doing to help us. We told them that we would do anything they needed for us to keep our home but we could not keep paying at these rates. They told us we had 5 options : 1 ) Foreclosure, 2 ) Short sale ( they would accept under {$700000.00} ), 3 ) Accept the loan modification with the balloon payment, 4 ) Make payments at 6.5 % and over the next 11 months the payments would be over {$18000.00} per month to catch the loan up and then it would be caught up and we would pay {$7000.00} per month for the remaining 18.5 years, 5 ) Pay the remaining balance in one installment. We explained to them that we are applying for the loan modification because we are in distress. We feel that they have been deceiving all along. We paid the full flood and hazard insurance out of pocket yet they added those amounts into the past amounts owed because they thought they paid them. We sent them proof from our insurance company and showed cancelled checks and they still kept those payments on our debt. It is unbelievable how bad they have treated us. We have done everything we can to keep our home and will continue to do so. Right now they said they will not accept payments from us until we sign the loan modification agreement but it will be like starting over when we have already paid over {>= $1,000,000} which includes what we owe on the other equity loan. We are good people that have always worked hard and did the right thing. All we are trying to do is to keep our family investment that we made almost 12 years ago with our parents that are now both deceased. We are asking for help to require Ocwen Loan Servicing to treat us fairly so we can keep our home. We are upside down on this house. We have told them we are willing to continue to pay for the next 18.5 years but we need the terms to change. We were requesting the principal balance be reduced to what they said they would accept on a short sale which is ~ {$680000.00}, the interest rate to be reduced to 3 % which they alluded to when we applied, and allow the loan to be on year 12 of the amortization schedule so the high interest payments don't start over. They told us if they short sale it then they would accept less than {$700000.00} ( they mentioned {$680000.00} ). All we are asking is that we get the same opportunity that a new person could come in and just get without any previous investment since we have so much invested already and have the desire to pay the loan.

Options to Prevent Foreclosure In //, I moved into an apartment located at     ,  , , MD .

I vacated my home because I was having difficulty walking up and down the stairs due to  and for other health and safety reasons. I have not made a mortgage payment since // and am very concerned about the possibility of foreclosure, particularly since the home is occupied by the prospective buyer. 

My real estate agent   advised me not to pursue forbearance because it may give the false impression that I am breaching my sales contract. I have every intention of selling my home as soon as possible. I would like to know whether a temporary forbearance for 2-4 months maximum would create an obstacle to the sale of my home, such as potential miscalculations of mortgage fees, interest and/or penalties, at settlement.

364,2019-03-26,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"In  of each year, I receive an escrow review statement from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. These statements advise me of any escrow account shortage. My // ( Exhibit 3 ) escrow review statement showed a shortage of only {$270.00}. The following year 's statement dated // ( Exh. 2 )  showed an escrow shortage of {$550.00}. However, my most recent statement ( Exhibit 1 ), dated //, inexplicably shows a shortage of a whopping {$2900.00}. 
A review of the escrow statements reveal that these shortages are based on "" projections '' ( page 2 of exh. 1 ). However, as page 3 of Exh. 1 shows, the projection formula is based on "" what [   ] expects to pay out. '' I have no idea how these year-to-year projection expectation amounts are determined, though I suspect that the increase is linked to a claim I made in . A neighbor whose rear yard abuts mine was working on his car in his rear yard and apparently did not have the vehicle properly braced. It consequently crashed through his rear fence, descended down the hill, crashed into the rear of my property, causing severe damage to the exterior and interior of my home. I have been using   through Wells Fargo as my escrow manager for over fifteen years without ever having to make a claim. I can only surmise that the huge increase in my escrow "" projection '' of what is expected to be paid out is somehow correlated to my damage claim which was not my fault. 
I am asking for an explanation from Wells Fargo and/or   as to how this exorbitant increase in escrow projection was determined. As I have observed, it appears to be correlated to my claim which goes against the basic tenet of insurance, which is to spread risk among the company 's insured so that no one is hit with a menacing escrow shortage in the event of a needed claim. 
Exhibit 1, page 3, shows that {$950.00} was paid to   County Revenue Department for my annual  property tax bill, so it is impossible to reconcile why my escrow account must be as high as {$2900.00} from {$550.00} the previous year. 
Additionally, I am asking for an explanation over the "" ESC REFUND '' indicated at the // line of Exhibit 1 page 3, as I do not recall receiving a refund, nor was I told that any refund was applied to the principal of my mortgage.

Hence, I immediately called to accept the modification terms on the Equity line of credit, and to decline the Home mortgage modification because it would hurt me in the long run. It was then and only then ( //2016 ), that I was told for the first time that both loans were contingent upon the other to be accepted. I felt this was unfair, based on the fact that I was not disclosed this type of outcome before I submitted my initial application, else I would have proceeded with just the Equity modification as I initially requested. Again, the option of both loans being contingent upon the other was not disclosed which smells of foul play by the WF Bank establishment. I later opened an investigation complaint with WF, who then noted that my original call was to indeed seek a modification on my Equity line of credit only, and that I was then offered to include the Home Mortgage modification later on the call. WF also noted that they do not disclose the possibilty of having the loans be contingent upon each other and openly stated that it was there right not to disclose the contingency clause or outcome and felt it was there choice even if it lead to an unfair outcome. I again affirm that the first time that I was told that the loans would be contingent upon each other was after I filed the application and not before. It was further reviewed with me when I tried to accept the Equity line of Credit over the Home Mortgage loan modification. account  and . I will attach two letters below.

I 'm enclosing the market analysis that was done on the house less then a year ago, by a real-estate agent, when I was looking into selling the house, he was not payed by me for the analysis.The house value now is -. So at this point I 'm stuck, the value of the house is too low to sale and pay off the mortgage, and the monthly mortgage payments with 6 % interest are unendurable.

When my mortgage was with   over 10 years ago, I made additional payments and asked the bank, to apply it into the principal but it was never applied, I received notices that "" I over payed, therefore I do not need to make payments for the next 2-3 month ''. I could see that my principle kept on increasing and was not able to do anything about it, the bank refused to make any arrangements to stop that trend.

I had no problem making these payments but I was surprise to find out that additional fees and interest were added, therefore my principle has being getting higher during that period.

451,2016-07-12,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,"AmeriSave Mortgage Corporation has acted in bad faith. 
At the beginning of my request for a refinancing, I asked whether AmeriSave would make a loan for a property held in trust. The answer was "" yes ''. 

After my submission of approximately  pages of documentation and payment of a {$570.00} fee, AmeriSave refused to close the loan unless I took the loan out of the trust. ( It should be noted that a copy of the trust was submitted very early on in the process. ) AmeriSave gives as a reason for refusal the fact that although the property is now held in trust as indicated in the title, the title lists only me as trustee whereas the trust also has my wife as a trustee. The said they would close the loan only if I took the property out of trust. AmeriSave 's bad faith reasoning is bogus, as can be demonstrated by the following : 1. A major bank refinanced this property several years ago with the exact same documentation and found no problem. The instrument used was the a standard  document. 
2. Based on a suggestion by an attorney, I offered - at my expense - to have the second trustee put on the title. This would have cured the problem cited by AmeriSave, but they still refused to close the loan. 

I should point out that my reasons for not taking the property out of trust are two-fold. First, added expense. Second, mortgage notes prohibit the change of title without lender approval so I could not put the property back into the trust without AmeriSave approval. Based on their past performance, I can not take a chance that they would not permit my putting the property back into the trust. 
Summing up : AmeriSave has acted capriciously and in bad faith. Their condition for closing the loan is not according to early assurances and, furthermore, is unreasonable based on previous history by another lender as well as the refusal to agree to a simple approach suggested by my attorney which, cures the problem they cite.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,AMERISAVE MORTGAGE CORPORATION,FL,32082,Older American,True,Web,2016-07-12,Closed with explanation,True,True,2007948,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['trust', 'property', 'title']"

I've been working with Better Mortgage on a mortgage application ; however, they have not been able to get anything right. They are either fraudulent or grossly incompetent/negligent. I will be filing a detailed report in the near future including all communications with the company and the misconduct. In the meantime, I'm wondering if there is any steps the CFPB can take to help get this loan closed. Most recently, Better Mortgage is refusing to provide a closing disclosure that has correct numbers on it. I provided them with the errors that needed to be fixed on the closing disclosure, but rather than just fixing the errors, they are insisting that I sign an erroneous document. The text of my most recent email ( sent on Friday evening //21 ) to the company is as follows : I hope you are aware of the implications of trying to force me to sign an erroneous closing disclosure. You are in violation of multiple regulations both at the federal and state (   PA  ) levels by even suggesting such. I see no indication that you have any intention of providing a closing disclosure that has correct numbers on it. The fact that these specific errors were brought to your intention but you refuse to provide a corrected document may even be criminal behavior. Based on an initial assessment, it's fraud. 

Throughout this process, Better has fabricated their own "" rules '' contrary to what is stated in the federal regulations. When I pointed out that Better is incorrect based on what is stated in the regulations, you simply fabricated another "" rule '' to try to cover the lie. For anything I disagreed with, I provided you with regulatory citations indicating the actual requirements. When I asked you to provide regulatory references to your bogus claims, you were unable to do so. I provided you with the EACT errors on the closing disclosure that needed to be changed. This should have taken all of ~ 20 minutes. A period of days have elapsed since I provided you with these errors. Instead of just making the corrections, you wrote email after email pressuring me to sign a falsified document. 

As  just brought you in on this application, I want to make sure we're both clear on the events taking place. If you have any intention of salvaging this deal, I urge you to make the corrections to the closing disclosure immediately. If you fail to do so, I'll take that as confirmation that it was your intention all along to mislead the consumer and that you never were willing to provide the services quoted at the quoted price.

536,2018-02-16,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"My mortgage is a 10 fixed / 30 year mortgage. It was originally serviced through  /   (   ) where they allowed me to set up bi-weekly payments that were withdrawn automatically from my account. After the 10 year term was over, my mortgage was transferred to SLS Mortgage. I asked to set up the bi-weekly payment ( where my mortgage would essentially be split in 1/2 and i would pay 1/2 my payment on the // and the remaining 1/2 balance at the each of each month - similar to what i had set up with / ). SLS advised that they would need to charge me to set this up so i set this up with my bank instead. I paid  on the // and  the // of month. Recently my mortgage went up slightly due to escrow increases due to my homeowners so this amount has slightly changed. Since my mortgage was transferred to SLS, i have had continuous issues when i call in on a monthly basis to have both my payments made ( the  and  combined and removed from their suspense account ) to be applied to my current payment due date - of which i am never late. I have been calling in monthly since my loan was transferred which has now been perhaps 2 years. Over the course of this time, they have taken some of my payments ( either  or  and applied to principal which i have asked them to reverse ) but in some cases they have told me that they can't and i would need to pay another similar amount in order to not be considered late on my payment. They have also started charging me late payments and when i ask them why, they have repeated stated that they will continue to charge me late payments ( even though i am paying on time ) simply because i am paying partial amounts and they will continue to do so until i change my method of payment to pay once monthly since their system is unable to support my payment style. Can someone please look into this concerning matter. In the beginning of my mortgage transfer, i had them note my account that i would be paying separate payments. I call in every month to have my payments reconciled and have had several agents tell me on the phone that my payments have been applied correctly only to find out that the agents processing my payments have still not processed my payments correctly where some of my payments are going to principal. Lastly, once my 10 year arm was expired, i called customer servicer and was told that my mortgage payment would increase to 2800ish that would include my estimated escrow. My mortgage increased dramatically and when i attempted to resolve with them, they stated that they would not go back and review calls made to reconcile whether the increase was accurate - i called several times during a course of perhaps at least 6 months on this issue. Any assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. 

A fair resolution would be the following : 1 - reverse all late payments since i have not been late, i have always paid on time and it is SLS who has misapplied my payments and at times even forced me to pay part of mortgage again. 

2 - allow me to continue to pay my mortgage split into 2 payments which are always paid on time.

3 - transfer my mortgage to another actual bank that can support my payment style.

4 - have SLS confirm that my rate increase from 1 1/2 years ago was accurate, i believe that the increase is incorrect based on what i was communicated by the customer servicer agent that gave me my estimated payment increase that included escrow.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Specialized Loan Servicing Holdings LLC,VA,20143,,True,Web,2018-02-16,Closed with explanation,True,True,2816807,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['mortgage', 'increase', 'payment']"

Nothing was ever indicated that I could possibly lose my home if I opted to take the moratorium during the initiation of the partial claim process of this loan. PNC made it seem as though I would be able to get back on track once the moratorium ended. It was never indicated or mentioned that foreclosure was an option. A letter was even mailed out stating that I had been approved for the partial claim and then it was retracted. Now you've sent a demand letter dated // the same day I called to make an inquiry and threatening demand and foreclosure of my home loan. However, on this same day at the time, I made the call I was told the home was not in foreclosure and that it was still in review two days later I received the demand letter. This is not the first time I have had issues with PNC keeping with their arrangements and/or agreements. I had to report them several years back regarding another issue during Hurricane Harvey.

Upon receiving the  Loan Mod Package, they advise I needed it to speak to a "" re entry team '' to see if I can  be review for a loan mod in which they just informed me to fax a new package, once again, mis interpretation from the servicer. The re entry team after an initial interview, advise me that I can be reviewed for a loan modification.

They refuse to show this on a payoff which leads me to believe that they do not want the customer to be able to pay them off. This also is an issue as it is a FDCPA and possibly a Reg  violation in terms of servicing the mortgage properly. 
In this case, the website shows a balance that includes the partial claim ( owned by HUD and serviced by  ). The statements show the same. The payoff does not. This leads to consumer lack of clarity on process and is not a correct display of information. Rocket Mortgage shouldn't show the balance of the second in the total  on their website and in their statements, but then choose not to do so on payoffs ( citing that the second is serviced by  and owned by HUD ). This seems like a scheme to continue to collect money while payoffs are delayed.

Customer service was absolutely embarrassing with their lack of knowledge, including not knowing their own website to help guide me to the information i was seeking. Escrow analysis. Open escrow analysis up and they analyzed that it was short back in  calculating that they had paid for the flood insurance when they did not. I pointed that out to the customer service representative and they just regurgitated what the analysis said on it. When the amount in the account was grossly OVER what it said it needed to be at for the month ( this is where i really started to crack down on where things went wrong ) contact my loan  who originated the loan for me back in . He stated that i should have called him before paying insurance directly. He and his team sent over documents from the transfer showing the amount of money that was in escrow at the time of transfer and their analysis which had calculated the amount for the flood insurance accurately to the dollar that i had paid out of pocket when they transferred. After having this information i called carrington again spending  minutes with automated voice before getting transferred to a real person who at the end of the hour conversation with him he told me he was sending my information to escrow to have them reanalyze the account to have them send me a check for the amount that was owed to me. Should be  business days ( lack of trust at this point ) i ask him for his direct line, doesnt have one. Asked for his cell so i can call if i havent heard anything after the  days. Doesnt want to give it to me but says he will call me in  days to update me on status. ( doesnt call after those   days ) calls me after  days and says that the escrow account was re-evaluated and a check should be on its way.

In  of , another Specialist from the Recovery Care Department contacted me. I worked with this Specialist for well over a year. And in  , I was denied again, because for the first time, Wells Fargo informed me that the investor holding my loan was not part of the  program and because of the type of loan I had, I was not eligible for any kind of loan modification. This after a whole year of providing the same paper work over and over again and obtaining a commitment from  to provide funds towards paying down my arrears!

635,2017-11-09,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,"I applied for my first mortgage against a home in   of . This was the first mortgage I had applied for, and the first mortgage that was going to be placed against my home. I needed to do some home renovations and updating. I filled out the application online with Regions Bank. I had  existing accounts and a credit card with them, and had zero problems with them prior to this. 
I applied for a home equity load and within the week, and my fiance and I went into one of the local branches off bernedette to sign the application paperwork so I could get the process beginning. I had been preapproved for {$40000.00}, had a credit score of almost  on my transunion report and a flawless payment history. I was told there was about {$80000.00} in equity in my home, the title was clear, and elected to take out a loan for {$35000.00}. I looked over the application and noticed it was for a home equity line of credit, and questioned this with the "" personal banker ''  . He said that a HELOC and home equity loan applications were the essentially, same process ect. He said the difference included a variable interest rate, that I did n't have to take out the full amount all at once and the draw/payment process. He said that at any time I could roll it over into a traditional home equity loan with a fixed rate and structured payment set. I signed and was out of the office in 10 minutes. He did n't give me a time frame on the amount of time it would take but a rough estimate of 3-4 weeks. So I waited. 
After 4 weeks, I had herd nothing from them so I called the  number for online applications and inquired. I was told that I was approved pending paperwork, and was told that the local branch would be in contact with me to process this. I schedule some concrete work that needed to be done before winter came, assuming that I was approved. After another 2 weeks, now 6 weeks after applying, I still had herd nothing on signing the paperwork so I called again. Initially, they could n't find an application on me at all. I called the following day again and did some checking, they researched it, found it, and had me contact a loan  at a different local branch in town off  . I called and scheduled a time to meet a day or 2 later. When I met him, he explained to me that the previous banker that had helped me sign paperwork was let go a week or so after I had gone in to sign paperwork. He already knew that I had been approved, it was just pending signing paperwork and with the shuffle of terminating the previous employee, my paperwork got lost. I explained that I had been waiting over 6 weeks and needed to get some work done on the exterior before it got too cold outside to do it. He told me to take out a personal loan, and then when the paperwork for the home equity loan went through that they would just pull money from that to pay back the personal loan and it would n't adversely affect my credit. I agreed to the personal loan. and he said he would be in touch with me in the next day or two to sign home equity loan paperwork. By the end of the week I had n't herd anything back. I contacted again the local branch off  again, he said he would check into it and call me back. 
The following week he called and said that the only loan  that was available for me to sign had lost his daughter and wife in an accident the prior week, but the loan  was going to come into the office on bernedette that day to sign paperwork with us. I met him over my lunch break went in and waited to meet. We sat for and waited almost an hour before he called us back to his office. He had the paperwork sat out told us to look over it, initial and sign where it was highlighted. He was stoic, and did n't ' explain much of anything. We asked about an insurance and taxes on the house he said we had to pay the insurance but the taxes would be paid out of the loan. We asked about the refinancing and said that we could refinance and take out more if needed, and as long as it was with regions there would n't be any charge backs for closing costs. We signed he said we had 72 hours to call and cancel, but then followed up that if we did cancel, we would be responsible for the {$8000.00} personal loan to be paid back in full by the end of the month. 
We ended up needing to use almost the entire balance of the HELOC to do the remodel, I started to get tax notices in the mail that needed to be paid. I called in  about the tax notices, they said that it sometimes happens with new loans that the address does n't get updated and the notices get sent to us She gave us an address and a fax number to send them to and told us it would be taken care of and if we got anymore to just forward them on. My fiance had an accident at the end of  and we had to get a new vehicle. In , we found out we had to pay sales tax on the new vehicle, I wanted to refinance my credit cards and we needed to finish renovations, so I called to refinance the heloc. I was told that I had to wait 6 months before reapplying for the finance. I though this was strange that I had to reapply as I was told I I could just refinance with no problems, but waited a couple of weeks to apply again. I called again a couple of weeks later to apply, did so over the phone and was denied. And was told it was because heloc was so new and not established yet. I was let go from my job about 4 weeks later in   of . I scraped, not once falling behind on any of my bills and finally was able to regain employment the end of . I decided then try reapplying with another company,  loans in . I filled out my application, and spoke with them. They denied me because I had n't been with my employer for at least 6 months ... 
In  of , I recieved a notice that my house was going to be put up for Tax Auction later that year in  for nonpayment of taxes. So I called regions to figure out what was going on. The representative told me that I was responsible for the taxes and insurance on the home and that with any HELOC, there is not an escrow nor did the bank pay them because they 're placed as  mortgages on the home. And the primary mortgage had the escrow account that paid the taxes and Regions was n't responsible. I explained that it was the only mortgage on the home, and there was n't a primary she said it did n't matter and suggested refinancing it into a traditional mortgage. I waited the 6 months like quicken had said to do and in  of , I needed to get some of my debts consolidated and pay the almost {$2000.00} in back property taxes now owed. My   was dropping and refinancing looked to be the best option to relieve this. 
I called Regions again to refinance, explained the situation and was sent to the    department. I told him my situation, that I needed to refinance the , get my credit cards paid off and explained the tax situation. I asked for an additional {$10000.00} on top of the {$32000.00} for the credit card debt and taxes. He told me that it should n't be a problem, with over half the equity still available and he could help. That it should n't take long for the credit report to come back and for him to speak with the loan officers on staff, and I waited on hold. He then came back on the line, and said that I had been denied, that my revolving balances on my credit accounts, including the regions HELOC was too high, and my income of {$40000.00} a year and credit score of  was too low to refinance. I panicked. 
In  I saw a commercial for an FHA backed refinance that was suppose to be for people with lower credit scores and income. I called  , explained the situation, and they claimed they would be able to help. Went through all the paperwork and they order an appraisal of the house. I waited about  weeks after applying and getting the paperwork for the appraisal, and he came out and accessed.   came back after the appraisal that there was an unfinished bathroom, some places where drywall needed to be repaired and the house needed flooring, all in all about {$6000.00} total to finish the work before they could proceed. I did n't have any way to finish the repairs so I canceled the refinance. 
Shortly after canceling the refinance, I received another notice of the tax auction paperwork and called regions corporate office in  of . I explained my situation to a lady in the department that deal 's exclusively with properties up for tax auction. I explained my story from beginning to end to her. She apologized over and over again for the situation Regions had put me in and decided to talk to somebody higher up to see what we could get done. 
I was contacted in  by  , a regional  for the  's in my area. He had gotten the complaint and wanted to meet with us to make sure he understood everything right. I called and explained the situation of what happened and he elected to meet with us. We met with him   at a local branch off . We once again explained the situation from beginning to end, and he apologized for all of the trouble we 've been having and wanted to see what he could do to make things right. The only thing we asked for was a refinance with cash out to pay off some debts so I could get my finances back under control. They were spiraling out and I did n't know what else to do. He mentioned that he recalled the loan  losing his family, and the one employee being let go. He said that the HELOC 's are handled by a different part of Regions all together. There was a  Mortgages and a Regions Bank. The HELOC was through the bank, and it should have been a home equity loan through the mortgage side. He said the only hangup now was the minimum  being required on my credit score. He had us meet with a mortgage office,   at the location off burnedette who pulled my credit score and it was at . He said there was n't anything he could do but he would relay the information on to  and he would be in touch.  called the following day and said that we needed to get some of the credit card debt paid down. That would bounce my credit score past the  to refinance. He said he could n't do any form of debt consolidation loan for us and refereed us to a gentleman at   giving us his name and number. 
I contacted onemain in  of  and got a plan together to get my credit cards paid down through a loan with them. We took out {$6000.00}, enough to pay the taxes and half my credit card debt, and paid them down. I took out the loan thinking it was going to be a short term loan and would turn around pay it off with the refinance. I waited for my credit scores to bounce back, and in  of  I contacted  again. He had me meet with  as before and I filled out another application. I was denied again, this time because my credit score on my equifax report was . My transunion report showed  and experian showed , but the mean score was just below what they said was required. This still baffles me because this was shortly after it was released that equifax had the huge data breech. None of my accounts had updated on equifax since the Spring. I had also found a new job with a starting salary of {$48000.00} and still have perfect payment history. 
On top of all this, I 've had to call   since  of  because they keep billing me for an 90 day insurance policy costing {$1600.00} on my home. My homeowners insurance has never lapsed and I 've been continuously insured since I got the home in  of . I have faxed the paperwork as has my insurance agent. They will take it off, and then I see it charged again the following month. 
I 'm at a loss now as what to do ... I fear for losing my home as I 'm struggling to make ends meet as is. I did everything I was suppose to do, listened to what each representative from Regions was telling me to do followed through with what they were suggesting. Now on top of everything I have an additional {$270.00} a month loan payment with the additional credit card payments and the heloc. I was n't budgeting for all these, because it was suppose to be paid off They threatened in  to close my credit card account, that of which has never been past due for a payment and only at 50 % credit utilization. It 's my longest open credit card account and would have damaged my credit every further had it been closed. I had to fight and fight to get them to keep that open. 
Bottom line, I followed the rules and researched, applied for a home equity loan, took the advice from the banker under the impression that it could be rolled over into a traditional home equity loan at any time with no problems. I was explained nothing by the mortgage office, who in my opinion should n't have been allowed to sign any paperwork with anybody under his personal circumstances, and pressured to not to reconsider under the 72 hours reconsideration time frame because of the personal loan I had taken out. I was told that the property taxes were going to be taken care of and they have n't been. Even after finding out I had to reapply, I tried reapplying 4 different times over the course of 18 months, but was denied because of the factors directly related to the HELOC. Called corporate and met with a regional  who apologized for everything and wanted to make things right. Followed his advice, took out a different loan that I 'm now stuck with because, yet again, I was lied to and told incorrect information.

The phone tree for this mortgage servicer makes it extremely difficult to get through to an agent for insurance escrow purposes. Once you go through the prompts for escrow purposes and select the insurance option, you are sent through a complicated maze of options with no option for a truly "" none of the above '' option. The first set of prompts provides a "" none of the above '' option, but this set of options also provides only three options, none of which also applied to me. I pushed zero to try to get through to an agent, and it said this was an invalid entry and that I had to push another button to go back to the previous menu, which again had options none of which applied to me. All I wanted to do was check in with the agent regarding the status of my insurance change, and had to wait over six minutes just to get through the convoluted maze of options to speak to someone. This is inappropriate and needs to change. When I tried to submit a complaint regarding this issue once I finally got through to someone, the agent said she could not take a complaint, and I had to submit a complaint to the customer service department. She proceeded to transfer me over to this customer service department, which again transferred back to the phone tree where I could not reach anyone.

In the same denial letter, they said my current housing expenses is less that equal to  % of my gross income ( meaning that I make too much money?? ) Again I am at a loss. And then finally they said that the number of modifications I have received exceeded the allowable amount. I have only received one modification and that was //, after a period of which I was unemployed. I have been offered a modification by   and I honored it by making the trial period payments. However they sold the note and transferred the mortgage to    , of which they did not honor the modification, even though I completed the third trial period payment to them.

As a result of the previously filed complaint, Cardinal Financial has extended an approved forbearance offer to the borrower in writing. However, the letter the borrower received has conflicting information. 

First, the cover letter dated //, advised "" to the extent possible, please sign and return the attached Agreement within fourteen ( 14 ) days of receiving this offer ''. 

This was inconsistent with the letter from   , Specialist with Cardinal Financials Loss  Department.   's letter states "" To accept our offer of FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT please call the number listed below to indicate your acceptance no later than // '' The FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT gives the borrower a deadline to send in the signed agreement by //. This is inconsistent with the // dated letter from Cardinal Financials Loss  Department, and with    's // dated letter. 

Additionally, the FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT has language that is unclear and contradictory. Specifically, under the "" Agreement '' section, it states : "" A ) Mortgagor ( s ) agree ( s ) to an APPROVED FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT WITH NO MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM // THRU //. THESE PAYMENTS MUST BEGIN //, AND ON THE  OF EVERY MONTH THEREAFTER THROUGH // ... '' I contacted Cardinal Financial Company and initially spoke with a representative who also reviewed the paperwork. The representative advised it appears the letter has a typo, but unfortunately Cardinal is unable to correct the document and the borrower must sign as is. I asked if the borrower can simply call and confirm she wants to accept the agreement, I was told no this would not be possible. I asked to escalate this case and ended up speaking with supervisor,  ( ID :  ). 

  ( ID : SAN ) acknowledged borrowers concern with the language but refused to admit to any typo and said that this was simply a template, it can not be corrected, and borrower must sign and submit form as is or she will not be approved for a forbearance. 

SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT Cardinal Financial Company sent the borrower mailed correspondence with three separate items : A // dated letter from their loss mitigation department, indicating the borrower has 14 days to submit the signed agreement; A // dated letter from    with the loss mitigation department advising the borrower they must call to indicate acceptance by // ; And the // "" FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT '' that states i. ) the borrower must send the signed form back to Cardinal to accept the forbearance by //, and ii. ) the FHA FORMAL FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT has language that states payments will be due from the borrower during the forbearance agreement.

I sent in a payment of about  back in  to bring the balance current and to finish paying off the loan. They rejected the payment on the grounds it wasnt sent the right way, yet and still I sent the money western union quick collect.

662,2021-12-09,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Synopsis : We are requesting help retaining our home of 24 years. It is being threatened with foreclosure after our  forbearance became due immediately. We assert our mortgage servicer, Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) and the investor,     , were deceptive by not providing clear and transparent information that   forbearance, a lump sum ( {$56000.00} ) was our only home retention option. We do not have anywhere near that amount and SLS has not given us any reasonable means to avoid foreclosure. Before forbearance we were current on our payments and never would have entered into  related forbearance if we had known a lump sum was the only resolution- we would have sought other options. Also, we were told we were evaluated and then reassured that there were other retention options during the 18-month forbearance. 


We have until // to make our account current or SLS will begin accelerated foreclosure and we will also be responsible for legal costs. If we didnt know better, we would think SLS and the       taking advantage of the pandemic to force us out of our home. We want to stay in our house and are willing to work together with SLS and the investor on any affordable options to prevent foreclosure. 

Detail : In // due to the  pandemic we had a reduction in household income. At the time we were current on our mortgage payments. I contacted SLS and inquired about forbearance and the terms. SLS stated they evaluated our account and it was given ( Exhibit A ). I never filled out an application or received any legal documentation describing any conditions or qualifications. With the continuation of  I extended the three-month forbearance six times and at each extension SLS claimed to evaluate our account before each extension ( Exhibit A ). 

I was concerned about the impact of forbearance and during the 18 months contacted SLS frequently asking about  options available ( Exhibit B ). The only letter I received indicating a lump sum was due at the end of forbearance was dated // ( Exhibit A, page  ) ; all the other extensions never mention this. In // before the end of the first forbearance, I was reassured by SLS agents that lump sum was not the only option and not to be concerned as almost always the deficit could be resolved with an affordable option and they would work with us. No documentation I received ever stated lump sum could be the only retention option. 

Forbearance ended on // and I was prepared and able to resume making monthly payments. On // I applied for loan mitigation assistance as instructed by SLS. Assistance was denied ( Exhibit C ) on //. SLS claimed the mortgage was at the loan modification limit according to investor guidelines. I had no indication this was a possibility and was shocked that we were being forced to give up our home unless we could come up with {$56000.00}. We do not have anywhere near this amount available. SLS offered short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure. We do not want to give up our home so these were not viable options for us. 

I requested an independent review on // and got the same response. In the appeal letter ( Exhibit D ) I stated that I was never informed about investor rules and was constantly told by SLS agents there were other options than a lump sum. The appeal was denied by SLS on // and communicated in a letter dated // ( Exhibit  ). In the rejection SLS stated "" ... a complete loss mitigation application was needed to evaluate the account for all available options. '' ( Exhibit  ). In effect SLS and the investor would not have told me this modification limit until I applied for a loan modification. However, this ""  '' requires that I go through forbearance to know my financial situation before I could apply for loss mitigation and only then find out there were no realistic retention options. 

I do not think the investor rules were difficult for SLS to discern and notify us. At each forbearance extension request SLS stated the account would be evaluated ( Exhibit A ). In the subsequent approval SLS never stated ( or discovered ) that the loan had exceeded the modification limit. I also note that for our appeal it took only three business days for SLSs independent review ( dated // ) to make this determination ( Exhibit  ) - implying this did not take much effort and could have been easily determined when we first applied for forbearance. 

Since being denied any retention options other than lump sum, on multiple calls to SLS I offered to accept a payment plan or any reasonable means to stay in our house. Currently, our financial outlook is positive and I restarted payments in // and will continue. It is only the  forbearance payments that are outstanding. 

Lastly, on //  sent a notification ( Exhibit F ) stating they will begin accelerated foreclosure in on // if we do not bring our account current. An SLS agent told me we are on the fast track for foreclosure. We are asking for some resolution before foreclosure begins and we are also liable for any legal costs. I have explored refinancing but we were unqualified because of the forbearance. I also looked into government mortgage assistance programs, but we are not qualified. 

Conclusion : We contend : 1. It was in the least negligent and possibly deceptive for SLS and the investor to have offered forbearance when they could have easily told me in advance that we were ineligible for loan modification. 
2. As such I did not get accurate and timely information to make an informed decision on forbearance. It is not my fault that we did not receive pertinent information that I had no realistic retention options. SLS stated they could not tell me this until I applied for a loan modification however it makes no sense to apply for a loan modification until I went through forbearance and only then knew our financial situation. Knowing that a lump sum was the only retention option, I never would have entered into forbearance and consequently put our home at risk. I was continually reassured during the extensions that SLS would work with us, but they arent. 
3. In the initial forbearance was I told the lump sum amount, all subsequent letters mention that SLS wont know the assistance that can be offered until I apply, but no lump sum is mentioned. In this correspondence they state : we realize that most people will not have the funds to immediately pay the months of paused payments 4. We do not know regulatorily what is required from the investor but the CFPB website page ( https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-forbearance-during-covid-19-what-know-what-do/ ) states : Forbearance ends with a payment plan, not a lump-sum payment Homeowners who receive COVID hardship forbearance are not required to repay their paused payments in a lump sum once the forbearance period ends. 
How can a lump sum payment be expected at the end of the forbearance when we did not have the means to keep up with payments to begin with? 
5. I was current on our mortgage at the beginning of forbearance and would have continued to be except for this natural disaster. COVID-19 is unprecedented and should be handled as such despite investor guidelines. We have financially recovered, resumed making payments, and will continue. 
. As a secondary complaint, during the last several months I never talked to the same person at SLS twice. I was assigned a single point of contact but that person was never available when I asked. Depending on who I talked to I was given different options on what possible actions to take. Most notably on // I talked for a long time with a very concerned and sympathetic agent who said she would propose a repayment plan to her team and let me know in a week. A week later after not hearing anything I called and talked to someone else who said it was denied almost immediately according to their records. Im not sure if I would have heard a decision if I hadnt called, but it wasted a week of our time on a tight timeline with foreclosure looming. Its also frustrating since I seemed to talk to two different departments, one has to do with mitigation and the other possibly foreclosure prevention. They dont seem to talk to each other. Each time I have to explain the circumstances and start from the beginning. 

I built the house in , raised a family here, and invested much time and money in upkeep and improvements. This is where my wife and I plan to retire. I repeat from our review letter to SLS and the investor : Despite the loan modification limit, we are also making an appeal for understanding and help. We are desperate to keep our home and all we have invested and honestly do not know where we will go if we are forced to move.

They clearly did not mention anything like that but they said it was included in the agreement which does not state that at all. I took forbearance because of financial hardship as my wife had lost her job due to Covid-19.

I talked to them in  and had stated to continue my payment as I was scared for foreclosure but they only took out one payment and stopped taking more payments even though I was enrolled in auto pay. I believe they did this so that my monthly payment of {$960.00} would keep adding up on my loan. In  they stated that they'll put me into a deferment plan and I would receive correspondence in a week but nothing was received from their side at all.

This year, I changed my homeowner 's insurance company which increased my total insurance charge by {$200.00} for the entire year.

Just before  last year we discovered that our dishwasher was leaking for quite some time. It was to the extent that our kitchen and adjacent bathroom floor were damaged, and mold had started to grow. The workman who discovered the leak advised us to contact our insurance company. The insurance company sent in teams to block off the kitchen area, remove the counters, flooring, and to conduct mold abatement. When this was completed and the tests came back negative, the insurance company recommended a contractor,   , to reconstruct the kitchen and bathroom. We signed a proposal with them and they were scheduled to start after the  holidays. 

On the day the contractor started work, I paid {$2500.00} towards the half of the {$31000.00} we agreed to pay them at the start. The remainder will be paid when the work is completed. Around that time we received a check from the insurance company for {$24000.00} made out to myself, my wife , and M & T Bank. 

 took the check to the M & T branch in   to get it endorsed. They refused and instead gave her a number to call. They also advised her to get a home equity loan.  called the number and was given an address and information to mail the check along with several documents. She complied, endorsed the check, and posted it with the documents. This was over five weeks ago. During this time, we received at least five calls from the bank requesting all manner of seemingly unrelated additional documents : some documents we already sent to them, some documents we don't possess, and some documents that are completely unknown to us. 

We sent the check to be endorsed and returned so that we can pay the contractors for their work. Instead, M & T Bank cashed the check and is now holding on to the funds.

708,2022-04-06,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,"Around //, me and my wife started looking to purchase a new home. At the time we owned our current home and still had a mortgage which we were paying each month. Due to the rental rates in our area, in // we made the decision to rent our home, instead of selling it. 
I researched lenders online to determine if there were any lenders that had less than 20 % down payment programs. I work in the mortgage industry ; therefore, I contacted a few lenders I know to see if they had less than 20 % down payment programs. Several of the lenders indeed had programs which offered less than 20 % down payment. Since most of the programs required at least 11 % - 15 % down payment, I decided to keep researching lenders for a program that allowed less than 10 % down payment. A lender named Paramount Residential Mortgage Group ( PRMG ) which states on their website ( link below ) We specialize in mortgages above the conforming loan limit with as little as 5 % down up to a sales price of {>= $1,000,000}. 10 % down up to a sales price of {>= $1,000,000}. Here the link to the website https : //losangelesjumbomortgageguru.com/manuel/?  #  I contacted PRMG to inquire about the 5 % down payment program. After speaking to the loan officer and understanding that I would have  as a second mortgage, I felt comfortable with the program and decided to obtain a pre-approval letter. I provided all the necessary information/documentation for the pre-qualification and on //, received a pre-approval for {>= $1,000,000}, with a down payment of {$62000.00}. Attached to this complaint is the pre-approval letter. 
Since we were looking for a new build there was one builder that refused the pre-approval letter, due to the mortgage company may not meet their deadlines for a conditional approval. 
On //, we entered into a purchase agreement with the builder , to purchase a home in the amount of {>= $1,000,000}.  also required conditional approval deadlines, which was //, and close of escrow deadlines which was //. PRMG was able to meet the first deadline and provided a conditional approval on //. However, on, //, I received an email from the processor on my loan at PRGM stating we are still short to close {$15000.00} not including the closing costs. At that moment, my wife and I were confused, how did we receive a conditional approval in , but now we are short to close {$15000.00} not including closing cost, nothing changed with our income, assets, or liabilities from  to . Instead of renting our property we made the decision to sell and use the proceeds to pay the {$15000.00} and closing costs. We informed PRMG that we were going to sell instead of rent the property. 
On //, our sell was completed, and I inquired with PRMG if we would be signing docs but was informed the  loan docs were still pending. //, at , I received an email from my loan officer at PRMG stating ; I am so sorry for the delay. Our second lien holder is giving us prolems since you sold your house. The change, changed our approval ( I would think for the better ) they are saying they are worried about payment shock and are worried that if one borrower leaves the others will have a hard time paying. They are NOW only wanting to approve us to 90 percent. We have the approval and can get docs but we have this change. 
I am so sorry. I think I am going to find a new second investor. Please call me if you want to discuss. The rate is better but it's an additional five percent down. Once again I'm sorry for the last minute change. We have been waiting for docs and I just got a call from management today. 
Once again we were confused since we sold our home we had over {$300000.00} in equity that we received, the day before we are set to close the  company will not approve an additional 5 % because they are worried about payment shock and on person might leave. Why would there be payment shock on a  loan that is // loan nothing changed with our income, assets, or liabilities. Also, there are four people on the loan. Myself, my wife, my wife mother, and my wife father. My wife and me have been married for 12 years and together for 25 years. We just had a baby //. My in laws have been married for 42 years. So, for PRGM to say they are worried if someone left the loan is not a condition for us to come up with an additional 5 % down, when we were conditionally approved by PRGM twice. Also, the loan officer offering to find another lender was not acceptable, when she knew that we needed to close escrow the next day. 
We did not want to pay the additional 5 %, but since we had sold our home and was waiting to close on the new home we were now , we had no choice, but to pay the additional 5 %. We paid the 5 %, closing costs and signed docs all on //. We were thinking the nightmare was over, but it was not. On Friday //, the end of the week, I was on the phone all day with the loan officer to confirm if we were going to close escrow and finally was advised that we would not be closing escrow. Once again PRGM was waiting on the  company to close escrow, but they did not receive a 1004D in time to close. Once again, I am in the business, a 1004D can always be provided post close as well, but a 1004D was keeping me  over the weekend. We finally closed escrow //, after , the builder sent an email stating they would not hold up the property any longer and would have to charge us 1 % for delay passed //.  and the   company was able to close escrow after receiving that email. 
This 5 % program that PRMG offers seems like a bait and switch program, since PRMG knew I sold my home and have additional assets prior to close. The conditional approval in // was based on use renting our home not selling it. We can not understand why the // approval was changed after PRMG was provided the final settlement statement from the sell of our home. I am sure this is a TRID and/or UDAAP bait and switch violation, since PRGM change the offer 2 days prior to close when they provided a conditional approval //.",,PARAMOUNT RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE GROUP,CA,92618,,True,Web,2022-04-06,Closed with explanation,True,True,5411989,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['approval', 'close', 'conditional']"

Guaranteed rate had then placed a Lender placed insurance at an high price on my behalf and sent me the bill. I had refuted this and they said they will review it and fix it.

I was told that my mortgage was approved and that we were ready to go to closing when that step was necessary. A week later, I was told that there were other requirements for the approval of my loan, that my current mortgage needed to be paid off, the closing date needed to be moved or the mortgage contingency on the contract of sale of my current house needed to be removed from the contract. I complained that they had already approved my mortgage and that these late requirements made it almost impossible. I sent a complaint to their complaint department and to their CEO and they reiterated their demands. Then they told me that they were not going to use my current mortgage in my debt to income ratio but that I needed to get a distribution plan from , the company where I have my IRA- this is not possible, there is no such thing- it is a self directed IRA. 

I made plans to purchase the new house with cash and choose another mortgage company in the future and so removed funds from the IRA as a short-term loan using the once-yearly rollover ability for IRAs. 

This morning, //2021, I was told that my mortgage was done and that I should wait for underwriting to send me the paperwork to review and approved so it can go to closing in time for the closing on //2021. Just hours later, I am sent the same demands for contingency removal and distribution plan. 

1- Better wants proof that I, as a retiree, can prove that I will have solid income for the future when they do not require this of people with jobs.

2- Better has told me on two occasions that my mortgage was approved only later to tell me they had the same requirements, requirements which I was told were no longer required.

3 - Better waited until no more time was available for me to get another mortgage before they started adding requirements to what was already an approved mortgage. 

4- Better required that I reinvest my IRA into an annuity so they could have proof of income. I am not sure that Better has the legal status to be providing securities advice and hold that advice as a requirement in their mortgages. 

I am prepared to buy my new home on //2021 with cash but will suffer when applying for a mortgage after the fact because of my rejection by Better and because it will be a cash-out refi on an already paid off home. If I can get a Better mortgage before //2021, I will, as that would be the simple solution even though I prefer not to do business with them any further.

Fay has stolen another {$2900.00} to start out the fiscal year of . 

I will break down how incompetent and derelict this entity is in performing its business. 
Because of improper use of my impound funds, Fay has caused penalties and interests to be accessed to my property taxes. This has gone on since they acquired the servicing of my loan.

I have requested that my impound account be canceled, that I will handle my own Ins. And Taxes. Fay refuses. So alas, I refuse to send my impound funds for them to play with. 

Point in case. 

I paid all of the taxes for  in full on //, see attached receipts. 
First-quarter payment of  taxes were due //. Fay sent a payment on //. This makes the payment past due 10 days with possible penalties and interest charged. This did not happen as I had paid them in full a month earlier. See attachments Second-quarter payment  taxes Fay sent a payment on //. Even after they were aware that all taxes had been paid in full for the year. See attachments I spoke to the County Treasurer and ask if they had received either of the so-called payments made to the  County Treasurer . Their reply was they could find no record of receiving them. And as the taxes had been paid in full. If they had received any payments, they would have been sent back to Fay. 

Now as of this date //2021, nothing has been refunded to my impound account. Of course, this is nothing new for Fay. They have not refunded the monies stolen in prior years. 

On //, I spoke directly to   who is supposed to be my account manager. I, ask him when they were going to refund my stolen monies. And of course, got no answer. Also questioned him about the ins payment that was coming due at the end of . Reminded him they had no need to pay it as I had already paid it in full on //. Confirmation Number . 
I ask him about all the problems. Breach of Contract, Improper use of my impound funds, stolen impound funds. Late or non-payment of taxes, refund of penalties and interest charged me for late or non-payments, refusal, and ignoring my Attorneys outreach.

Now here we are again. Fay has removed another {$2000.00} from my impound account.

I was promised a 30 day close and given CD paperwork to reflect that deadline. I was also assured that we would close at the end of //, then the excuses started rolling in ; first they blamed that my other house had not sold, that was taken care of, then I needed 3 letters of explanation from my employers, I had to change bank account information, I needed no less than 15 different letters of explanation and some were provided multiple times to multiple parties, and at least 70 pieces of supporting documentation.
I would return all documentation promptly and often wait 2 to 3 days to even hear back from DHI employees. When they would call, it was often at  on Fridays with the statement that additional documentation was needed immediately and this would further hamper my loan process if not immediately received. After returning the documentation, I would not hear back until the middle of the next week. Also, when contacted, more than once I was contacted by one individual and then when re-engaged that person was off for the next week and would be shuffled to another. No consistency on who was actually handling my loan at any given time.
In addition, I paid for a mortgage lock, but since DHI continued kicking the loan down the road, that was extended multiple times and I was charged for it. DHI should have at least eaten that cost.
Every step of the process it was stated it would only be a few more days, whereas by // ( 20 days later than originally promised ) and several mysterious layers of approval, my loan was finally turned back on ( apparently it was shut off ) and the process started again to finally close on the//. Many times I had asked and had another lender waiting ready to approve my loan, but was told it would be only a few more days. In truth I was being strung along to keep me at DHI. I should have followed my intuition and pulled out of the situation at the first sign of trouble and moved onto the original lender Integrity. I stayed because I believed DHI and their employees would be looking out for my families best interest. Clearly I was mistaken.
Although we received a large credit, it did n't make up for the additional {$4000.00} in expenses incurred due to DHI 's mortgage process. We incurred expenses for a month of lodging ( week at a time, due to being strung along ), additional storage truck rental, storage space rental, additional POD rental, purchasing day to day living supplies, added fuel charge, flight rescheduling, additional airline travel, and missed work for my spouse due to transportation challenges. This does n't even address the rescheduling needed for buses, a fence install, internet install, furniture delivery, to name a few. Pushing it back 3 different times also caused additional fees ( {$750.00} ) for a mortgage lock that I needed to pay although DHI was the reason for the delays.This almost drove us entirely from the home to start looking elsewhere. The irony of the situation is I was counseled by members of DHI on fiscal responsibility, but yet they were the very institution causing fiscal stress on my family. Is this standard practice!?!
Overall I ca n't remember a time I was treated worse by a service provider, let alone as a veteran. We were misled, strung along, lied to, belittled, and treated overall like our business did n't matter. This being said I would never put my name behind DHI and would tell anyone that asked that they should be avoided at all costs. The fiscal promises fall short and do not even go on to compensate for the emotional and  stress caused by your organization.

822,2021-09-29,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"RE : FORCING ME TO PAY FOR HAZARD INSURANCE ON A HOME THAT BURNED DOWN IN  I am in the process of rebuilding. 

My home burned down in the California  Fire on //. Since that time I have been involved in rebuilding my home. It takes 4 to 10 years to rebuild a home in   County. I have a building team who is busy getting each and every permit needed for the final permit to start actual stick building on site. 

My insurance company reimbursed me the funds held by my mortgage company. My mortgage company, LOANCARE, is holding the final amount of the mortgage, on which I make a payment each and every month while I am in the process of rebuilding. 

In  I cancelled the insurance on my home because my home burned to the ground totally and my property is now a hole in the ground where the home building once stood. Then my mortgage company has an insurance division that contacted me and insisted that I must pay hazard insurance in order to have a mortgage with them. I sent multitudinous letters explaining that the home burned down and I no longer need insurance for a home that is not existent. But I discovered that LOANCARE is divided into two companies one for sending you mortgage payment slips and another section that simply makes sure you are paying insurance. These two sections do not communicate and do not share information. It took me two weeks of constant phone calls to contact a supervisor who insisted I had to prove my home burned down. So I sent him two papers proving my home burned down and then they stopped attaching insurance that they purchased for my home to my mortgage payment. 

Now the insurance section of LOANCARE is once again sending me letters insisting that I take out hazard insurance on my home or they will take out insurance for me and add that on to my mortgage. I have called many times spending hours navigating their robot phone system to try to reach a supervisor. It seems I can only reach lower workers called resolution advisors who will tell me that they have my information somewhere in their files but unfortunately their system is robotized so that they will keep sending me letters to force me to pay insurance on a home that does not existor they will continue to take out insurance for me and add that to my mortgage payment. 

Either this is a scam or this company is so poorly managed that they just automatically do this to everyone. 
My home burned down in California. This company LOANCARE, located in South Carolina, took over my loan from my local bank a few years before the fire occurred. They have no knowledge or understanding of local conditions in my area. Most of their agents read from prepared scripted letters, listen to what I say and DO NOTHING. 

I have called the mortgage section of LOANCARE and they tell me they can do nothing about the insurance section since they are not connected to their data base. All they can do is give me the phone number of the insurance section. 

I had my home burn down totally. I proved it to them. I can not afford to pay insurance for a home that does not exist. I am now considering if there is a way to sue them for pain and suffering since I spend hours and days calling them to try to prevent them from taking out insurance on a burned down home which is now a hole in the ground. Their automated web site has no place to explain this. It is only set up to take in the number and name of your insurance policy. 

What can I do to stop this from happening? My building team suggests I contact government services or find a way to sue them to stop this process.

The total balance owed ( according to their records ) is {$520000.00} that is 154 % more than what the home is worth. I purchased this home for {$400000.00} and the current value is estimated at {$340000.00}. I am now sitting 153 % loan to value although I consider this a home and not an investment, this modification does not make sense for me or my family. 
if I may and allow me to elaborate, I bought this home in 2007 with 80 % financing through . 
I was fit into ARM interest rate 7.00 %, recast and capped to 10 %, monthly mortgage payment jumped from {$2000.00} to {$3000.00}. Ive been recently unemployed have been unable to find work and began struggling with the mortgage payment. That was my full-time job now and my family I made a decent living. The problem is that between the time I became unemployed my household income was slashed in half and that is when I defaulted on the loan. Not long after the loan was transferred to Mr. Cooper I began trying to negotiate a home retention program. I could not make any progress same excuse that the necessary documentation to proceed was not received. It led me to believe that due to these findings that their company would provide me with a reasonable workout. However, instead of working with me, once again Mr. Cooper behaved unethically and set an acceleration to foreclosure. Luckily at the last minute someone in their legal department or somewhere else must have realized that trying to sell this property at foreclosure would be a disaster because Mr. Cooper could not show continuity of obligation nor prove their legal right to sell the home. 
The amount that I am required to pay on this loan to satisfy is doubled of what I paid. The home is worth fraction of what I paid.

The flood hazard status of a property is determined by its location on maps produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ).

Occasionally FEMA revises the boundaries of the "" Special Flood Hazard Areas '' ( SFHA ) on its maps based on the construction or improvement of canals and levees that mitigate the possibility of losses from flooding in certain areas. 
LoanCare , LLC has recently contracted with an independent provider whose goal was to perform a flood zone determination on your property and to determine the location of your property on the current FEMA maps and identify its flood "" Zone '' status. There was no cost to you for this review. 
The results of the review indicate that your property is not located within a SFHA on the current FEMA maps. LoanCare , LLC does not require flood hazard insurance to be carried on properties that are not located in SFHA.

We understand that you may want to continue this coverage. However it is not a requirement and therefore, it is not our policy to have this as part of the monthly escrow payment. As a result we have deleted the monthly escrow for flood from the mortgage payment and performing an analysis of your loan. When this is completed you will receive a notice stating the change and if there is an overage you will receive a check. 
If you have any questions, please contact our Insurance Center at   between  -  Monday - Friday EST,  except for major holidays. 
Sincerely, Insurance Department  -- -- This letter is what I had to give to FEMA to cancel the flood insurance. If the lender didn't remove it they will not allow for it to be removed.

In // my automatic payment to my mortgage company was returned due to the draw happening one day before the money was in my bank account. I noticed that happened when I checked both my mortgage account and banking info online. I attempted to pre-empt a late payment/fee by manually submitting another payment. My manual payment was processed correctly. However, Amerihome 's automated system attempted to take another payment and I didn't want my bank account to be overdrawn. So I had to issue a stop payment against Amerihome drawing from my bank account a second time. I also had to have Amerihome return the second payment because it had been processed and my bank account was affected. 

Now, for my // payment which was supposed to auto-draft on // I didn't realize I needed to contact the bank again to remove the "" stop payment ''. So, when Amerihome 's automated system tried to draw on my account it was denied. Again, I realized this before my payment would be late ( on // ) and I contacted the bank to remove the "" stop payment ''. Then I logged onto my account in the Amerihome web portal to try to submit a manual payment but the online system indicated that I could not use that function at that time. So I called Amerihome. The bank did remove the "" stop payment '' but the Amerihome rep who I spoke to on // did not help me at all. She said she couldn't see that the payment hadn't gone through. I should have just asked to submit another payment at that time but I couldn't foresee all the trouble I was going to have issuing a payment beyond that point. 

I intended to call back on // to give time for their system to catch up. However, I was ill that day ( I even got a   and have proof of doing so ). So, I wasn't able to call Amerihome again until //. 

On // I spoke to 3 different people who each told me that the reason I couldn't use the online system ( or the phone system ) to make a payment was because they were now requiring a certified check only. I argued that the payment hadn't been denied due to insufficient funds so requiring a certified payment didnt make any sense and could I please have that waived so I could make the payment over the phone and it not be late. I was told by the 3rd person I spoke to ( Ms.  rep # , in the Loss Mitigation dept. ) that she had the authority and ability to override the requirement for the certified check. She then proceeded to accept my payment with an additional fee of {$9.00}. She gave me a confirmation # of the payment transaction (  ). She said it could take up to 3 days to process the payment especially because the  was a national holiday (     ). 

So I have checked my banking and Amerihome accounts online everyday since and noticed once again that the payment has not been processed. Now, //, I am on the phone with Amerihome again and have been told that the payment was never processed because they could not override the need for a certified check and that the payment is now late and that I must send a certified check. Now I am at my wits end feeling as though I have been scammed this whole time. As I write out the details of this complaint I am on hold with Amerihome trying to speak to someone with some authority to assist me. 

My complaint that I wish to file against Amerihome encompasses the following : 1. Minor complaint : Their system was at fault for trying to draw a second payment after I had made an on-time payment manually. When I tried to alert Amerihome of what was happening they provided little assistance and no concern that their system might be flawed. 
2. Major Complaint : That my payment was still not processed after being told that Amerihome 's system 's requirement for a certified check was overridden and having been given a confirmation number for a payment made. 
a. Not honoring a payment made in good faith and, being asked to make that payment again with a late fee. This seems predatory and unethical. 
b. Throughout this entire situation I have been trying to pay on my mortgage in a timely fashion. However, Amerihome has blatantly lied to me at least once and consistently blocked me from making a payment. 

I believe I have made more than every effort to resolve this situation in a reasonable manor but that Amerihome is not cooperating. 

At this very moment : I am once again speaking with someone in customer service (  ) who says she can override the need for a certified check and take my payment. But how can I be assured that is the case?

903,2021-03-11,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"Follow-up to Transaction ID  from  Case #  Since my initial complaint in , I have recently asked Wells Fargo numerous times with no answer whether my wife,  ( divorcing ) has signed, notarized, and submitted the HUD partial claim 2nd lien loan on our house. After several attempts at communication,  has finally answered me about the issue on //, and said that she did sign and send in the loan documents to Wells Fargo several weeks ago. Yesterday,//, Wells Fargo Home Preservation Department told me they can not find my wife 's signed and notarized HUD partial claim contract documents in the Wells Fargo system. Either Wells Fargo has misplaced the documents, is intentionally withholding them from me, or my wife did not send in the documents. Married couples sign mortgage documents together ; ours are separate. I need to see we are signing the same documents and she actually signed them. I require a full copy of the signed and dated by my wife HUD partial claim documents, and Wells Fargo is not sending me a copy because they are saying they don't have it even though my wife says she mailed it to them weeks ago. 
My wife 's actions by not paying the mortgage on our house for 7 months in 2020 are a direct breach of the  Court 's//Agreed Temporary Orders forbidding encumbrance or additional loans on our house. She incurred debt of almost {$9000.00} over 7 months in 2020 all on her own without my knowledge or consent, no notice to the Court, and Wells Fargo did the same working with her, all without my knowledge or consent. On // I faxed the entire 21 page ATO agreement to the Wells Fargo Executive Offices including pointing out the relevant Court Orders and confirmed with Wells Fargo that they received the documents. 

This past fall, Wells Fargo told me in writing and on the phone several times that either borrower party had the right to put the loan into forbearance and modify the loan as allowed by the loan Note. There is no such language allowing unilateral action in the note by just one of the two borrowers. In a phone call and in her WF letter on ,  , Case Specialist with the Executive Offices, Wells Fargo finally agreed that the Note my wife and I signed at closing on the house in  does not state it "" allows anyone who signs it the authorization to make changes to the account, which include requesting payment assistance ''. This was a statement they had "" confirmed '' to me in their letter dated . Now the WF Executive Offices have agreed the confirmation was incorrect and the Note does not allow for such unilateral action. But still say both parties must sign the HUD partial claim loan in order to prevent foreclosure. 
Wells Fargo has been deceptive, and misrepresented the contractual obligations to me, their customer. I am being forced into this disobedience to the  Court 's Orders by  and Wells Fargo. This should be  's sole {$9000.00} debt based on her actions with Wells Fargo and breach of the Court 's ATO Agreement. This seems very wrong. However, in order to keep out of imminent foreclosure by my wife 's actions, for the current benefit of our children, and to try and preserve our house equity as much as possible, I will sign the HUD partial claim loan under protest.

I had given verbal authorization for Citi Mortgage to discuss options with him and the information was "" NONEISTING '' after 8months after they had been in contact with him ; thus again forcing me to jump through their hoops to allow them to discuss the case. We then applied for the hardship loan modification. For almost a year we paid the amount that we thought was the payment amount.  of 2016 Citi Mortgage began sending our payments back to us. At this point I could no longer continue the endless battle and we entertained putting the house up for sale. In  Citi Mortgage sent me a letter notifying us that our mortgage had been sold. All paperwork was provided to the lawyer and relator with the New mortgage holder 's information. When my relator called the company that our mortgage was sold to she was told, "" Not all files have been sent over and information is limited. '' My lawyer then contacted the same people only to be told that the mortgage was NOT sold that Citi Mortgage still holds the account. My Lawyer then contacted Citi Mortgage, at this time Citi Mortgage is requesting us to re-apply for a loan modification. There was NO explanation given as to why we received the letter, Nor why my relator was told one thing and the lawyer another. 
I have LOST complete faith in this company! NO ONE there knows what is going on and all that I get is a CONSTANT RUN AROUND and jumping through hoops. They are selective in the notes that are applied to the account. One month they will speak to the lawyer and relator and the next I need to submit a formal letter ( AGAIN! ) to Citi Mortgage to allow them to discuss my case. At this time we are attempting a short sale unfortunately Citi Mortgage will not provide a FINAL payoff figure to the relator making the sale of the house DIFFICULT.

Instead, BofA report a payment past due record which currently impacted my credit score significantly for over  ( from  to  now ). I'm here to provide more information about my situation. Really need your help on this matter. 

Timeline : 1. I had a mortgage with Bank of America for the last few years. I had the auto payment setup which linked to my checking account of BOA as well. It went well for the last few years. And I try to pay my mortgage faster than the original schedule. 
. On //2022, I checked my mortgage and saw there is only {$1500.00} remaining on its balance. Thus I manually payed this amount via Bank of America from checking account to mortgage account. The amount was deducted from checking account successfully. 
. Since //2022, the last three statements of my mortgage shows the total amount due is {$0.00}. Attached please find those statements. 
. On //2022, the above amount still didnt apply and I noticed that my credit score got negative impact significantly. Bank of America report a "" past due ''. I checked with Bank of America via their customer support and was told that I need to pay {$140.00} additional fees to payoff the loan which was not showed anyway in app / website / statements. 
. On //2022, I payed this amount via Bank of America from checking account to mortgage account. The mortgage got payoff and account got closed right after that. 

The problem is : (  ) if BOA need charge me those additional fees, why its system didn't charge via the auto payment which I always had enough balance. 
(  ) Those additional fees didn't show anyway in their mobile app, website, even in mortgage statements? which I wouldn't know at all if I didn't noticed my credit score impacted. 
(  ) I payed this mortgage way faster than the original schedule which caused a past due seems didnt make sense to me at all. 
(  ) I contacted BOA and they refuse to accept that their product design is really confusing. The auto payment function didn't work properly. Their app/website/statements didn't give customer the right amount due information.

In discussions with our Mortgage Servicer (     ) about repayment of our missed loan payments while in forbearance, we had made an agreement on // that we would use the VAPCP Program ( VA Partial Claim Payment Program ). Wherein the VA purchases the forbearance period missed payments and places them in a second lien on the home, which is interest free and payable when the property is sold. 


On // the servicing of our loan, not the loan itself, was transferred to PNC Bank. We have come to find out they will not honor the agreement made with our previous servicer nor will they consider the VA Program as an option. ( verified in recorded phone conversations ). 


They are attempting, with the threat of foreclosure, to force us into filing a Hardship Assistance Application. This in itself would be fraudulent because we are not in a financial hardship situation. This Hardship Assistance Application is 16 pages long and is very similar to a new loan application. If we comply, it will give PNC Bank the right to dictate the manner in which the missed payments are paid back. This is entrapment. 


Through  telephone conversations ( most recorded ) we have determined that their end game is to do what they call a ""   ''. In reality, it will be a new loan because it will have a new total, a new interest rate, a new term length, and of course new fees. 


First, this enables them to add the missed payments into the entire length of the mortgage which will greatly increase the loan. As an example of which, early on, our former servicer attempted the same thing. They upped the interest rate and added  years to our loan, which equalled approximately {$110000.00}, to repay the missed payments which were {$32000.00}, an {$87000.00} fee to borrow {$32000.00}! 


Secondarily, they will now be able to sell the new larger loan and get a big payday because our home has doubled in value, making the loan more lucrative to an investor. 


In summary, If PNC Bank wanted to be simply paid back, they could use the VA   , which we chose, and have their money overnight. It is outrageous that a   Bank, bailed out in  to the tune of   taxpayer dollars, is using this  economic tragedy to rip off the "" little people '' that, back then, saved them.",,PNC Bank N.A.,AZ,85119,"Older American, Servicemember",True,Web,2021-12-02,Closed with explanation,True,True,4971131,[0. 0. 0. ... 0. 0. 0.],"['new', 'forbearance', 'loan']"

I also spoke to customer service on // and     on // to inquire about a response. And both told me that my documents still had not yet been updated in the system. 

This is particularly disappointing because since my loan was transferred to Bayview in //, I have had a terrible customer service experience. I started working on a Deed in Lieu around that time and it was stalled for over two years due to lack of responsiveness from   at Bayview and overall failure from Bayview to move my file forward, despite having had a complete file on three separate occasions. This repeated and seemingly deliberate failure to move forward my deed in lieu requested created a disparate impact on me and also resulted in a financial hardship on me. With the unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices ( UDAAPs ) policy in mind, I filed a complaint with the CFPB last year. After CFPB involvement, my deed in lieu was finally moved forward and eventually approved in //. At that time, I was advised that any and all debt, fees, and obligations had been dissolved and that I as no longer liable to Bayview. 

However, unfortunately, I continued to receive bills/statements from Bayview. I contacted   at Bayview on // to inform her of this and she advised that this bill/statement was an error and that Bayviews system simply needed time to update. I contacted her again on // to advise about that I was still receiving bills/statements and she said that the deed had been recorded and that I should not be receiving bills. 

Nevertheless, I continued to receive bills/statements. I spoke with   on // who assured me that the deed in lieu had been approved by Bayview, that everything had been processed on your end and that she showed a  balance for my loan in her system. I am frustrated and upset because I continue to receive bills/ statements and I thought that this matter had been resolved. 

I am reaching out to CFPB as it seems this issue has still not been resolved. So I am asking for you to help me to rectify this situation with Bayview.

IF THE LENGHT OF THE LOAN WAS ETENDED A BALLOON MUST NOT BE APPLIED. 

If the loan was extended an additional 8 years, overcharging a person with an extra balloon payment is basically usury.
